	4. Inversions _ p41
		Chapter 2.3-7 problem 2-4
		Let A[1..n] be an array of n distinct numbers. If i<j and A[i]>A[j], then the pair(i, j) is called an inversion of A.

	5. maximum-subaray problem _ p68
		Given an interget array A with n integer numbers, calculate the subarray which has the maximum sum for all the elements. Chapter 4.1.  (Theta(n lgn))
		
	6. Question 4.1-2 _ P74
		Write pseudocode for the brute-force method of solving the maximum-subarray problem. Your procedure should run in Theta(n^2) time.
		
	7. Question 4.1-5 _ P75
		Use the follwing ideas to develop a nonrecursive, linear-time algorithm for the maximum-subarray problem. Start at the left end of the array, and progress toward the right, keeping track of the maximum subarray seen so far. Knowing a maximum subarray of A[1..j], extend the answer to find a maximum subarray ending at index j+1 by using the following observation: a maximum subarray of A[1..j+1] is either a maximum subarray of A[1..j] or a subarray A[i..j+1], for some 1<=i<=j+1. Determine a maximum subarray of the form  A[i..j+1] in constant time based on knowing a maximum subarray ending at index j.

			T(n) = Theta((2**m+1)**lg7) = Theta( (2**m)**lg7 * 2**lg7) = (2**lg7) * Theta((2**m)lg7) = Theta((2**m)lg7) = T(n)
			
	9. 4.2-4 
		What is the largest k such that if you can multiply 3*3 matrices using k multiplications (not assuming commutativity of multiplication), then you can multiply n * n matrices in time o(nlg 7)? What would the running time of this algorithm be?
		T(n) = KT(n/3) + f(n**2):
			First, to calculate C = A * B, split A, B, C as 3*3 sub-matrixes, then do the multiplication, there will be K submatrices mulplications. And there will be f(n2) elements additions. 
		Check Master theorem, we get T(n) = Theta(n**log_3-K), and it is o(n**lg7), so we need n**log_3-K < n**lg7, i.e. log_3-K < lg 7

	12. 4.2-7 
		Show how to multiply the complex numbers a + bi and c + di using only three multiplications of real numbers. The algorithm should take a, b, c, and d as input and produce the real component ac ? bd and the imaginary component ad + bc separately.
			The three multiplications are 
				P1 = ac,
				P2 = bd,
				P3 = (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd. 
			The real component ac - bd = P1 - P2, and the imaginary component ad + bc = P3 - P1 - P2.
	13 4-5 Chip testing
			Professor Diogenes has n supposedly identical integrated-circuit chips that in principle are capable of testing each other. The professor＊s test jig accommodates two chips at a time. When the jig is loaded, each chip tests the other and reports whether it is good or bad. A good chip always reports accurately whether the other chip is good or bad, but the professor cannot trust the answer of a bad chip. Thus, the four possible outcomes of a test are as follows
			a. 
			If more than n/2 chips are bad, then there are fewer than n/2 good chips. Good chips can reflect true states, that is, returning "good" for good chips and "bad for bad chips.
				Let's divide all chips into three groups, m good chips(Group A), m bad chips(Group B), and n-2m bad chips(Group C). If test results are as below:
				   A B C
				A: G B B
				B: B G B
				C: B B B
				Then Group A and Group B behave identically. Thus we can know one of the two groups is made of good chips, but we can't determine which group is.
				
			b. Consider the problem of finding a single good chip from among n chips, assuming that more than n/2 of the chips are good. Show that floor(n/2) pairwise tests are 
				sufficient to reduce the problem to one of nearly half the size.
				
				Split [n/2]*2 chips into [n/2] pairs of chips .If the test result is "good" for both chips, it can be determined that the two chips are of the same state, 
				both good or both bad. So we just need to find the state of one chip, and the other's state is determined.
				If there's "bad" result for either chip, just discard them temporarily. When the final result is determined, that is, good chips are determined, we can 
				just use these good chips to determine the chips that we discarded. Thus the problem is of almost half the size.

			c. Show that the good chips can be identified with 成(n) pairwise tests, assuming that more than n/2 of the chips are good. Give and solve the recurrence that describes the number of tests.
					T(n) = T(n/2) + 成(n)
					Thus T(n) = 成(n)
	14. 5.1-2 
		Describe an implementation of the procedure Random(a, b) that only makes calls to Random(0,1). What is the expected running time of your procedure, as a function of a and b? 
		The probability of the result of Random(a,b) should be pure uniformly distributed, as Random(0,1)
		
		Solution: 	
			See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8692818/how-to-implement-randoma-b-with-only-random0-1

		1) Find the smallest number, p, such that 2^p > b-a.
		2) Perform the following algorithm:
			r=0
			for i = 1 to p
				r = 2*r + Random(0,1)
		3) If r is greater than b-a, go to step 2.
		4) Your result is r+a
		
		Solution 2:
		An idea I just had, in case it's about integer values: 
			Use bisection. 
			At each step, you have a range low-high. If Random(0,1) returns 0, the next range is low-(low+high)/2, 
			else (low+high)/2-high. 
			Details and complexity left to you, since it's homework. O(lg (b-a))
			
			
			That will only produce an approximately uniform distribution. Consider (1,3).
			
	15. 5.1-3 
		Suppose that you want to output 0 with probability 1/2 and 1 with probability 1/2. At your disposal is a procedure BIASED-RANDOM, that outputs either 0 or 1. It outputs 1 with some probability p and 0 with probability 1 = p, where 0 < p < 1, but you do not know what p is. Give an algorithm that uses BIASED-RANDOM as a subroutine, and returns an unbiased answer, returning 0 with probability 1/2 and 1 with probability 1/2. What is the expected running time of your algorithm as a function of p?

		Analysis:
			User binary tree we can see:
			==>1==>0 is p(1-P) and ==>0==>1 is p(1-P), all others, we need to do it again
			
		Solution:
		Suppose that you want to output 0 with probability 1/2 and 1 with probability 1/2. At your disposal is a procedure BIASED-RANDOM:
			BEGIN:
			if heads then tails, return heads
			if tails then heads, return tails
			otherwise, goto BEGIN

	16. 5.2-1 
		In HIRE-ASSISTANT, assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order, what is the probability that you hire exactly one time? What is the probability that you hire exactly n times?
			HIRE-ASSITANG(n)
				best = 0
				for i=1 to n
					interview candidate i
					if candidate i is better than candidate best
						best = i
						hire candidate i
		Solution:
			The probability that you will hire exactly one time corresponds to the event that the strongest candidate is interviewed 1st. The probability of this event is 1/n.

			The probability that you will hire all n candidates corresponds to the event that the candidates are interviewed in weakest每to每strongest order. The probability of this event is 1/n!

	17. 5.2-2 
		In HIRE-ASSISTANT, assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order, what is the probability that you hire exactly twice?	
		
		Solution:
		Which means the first two are hired only. So should be 1/n!
		
	18. 5.2-3 
		Use indicator random variables to compute the expected value of the sum of n dice.
		
		Solution:
			Let X1, X2, . . . , X6 be the random varibles which count number of times faces 1, 2, . . ., 6 come up. 
			Let The X be the random variable corresponding to sum of n dice rolls. E[X] = 1E[X1] + 2E[X2] + . . . , +6E[X6]. Expected value E[Xi], is n/6
			So E[X] = 21/6 * n = 3.5n
			
			
	
	19. 5.2-4 
		Use indicator random variables to solve the following problem, which is known as the hat-check problem. Each of n customers gives a hat to a hat-check person at a restaurant. 
		The hat-check person gives the hats back to the customers in a random order. What is the expected number of customers who get back their own hat?
		
		Solution:
			Use indicator. For hat i, the chance it was returned to its original owner is 1/n, because of the random order. 
			E[X] = E{Sum(Xi)] = n * 1/n = 1 
			
	20. 5.2-5 
		Let A[1..n] be an array of n distinct numbers. If i < j and A[i] > A[j], then the pair (i,j) is called an inversion of A. (See Problem 2-4 for more on inversions.) Suppose that the elements of A form a uniform random permutation of (1,2,...,n). Use indicator random variables to compute the expected number of inversions.
			
		See: http://www2.hawaii.edu/~suthers/courses/ics311f11/Notes/Topic-05.html
			
		Solution:
			Let Xij, i < j, be an indicator random variable for the event where A[i] > A[j] (they are inverted).
			Pr{Xij = 1} = 1/2 because given two distinct random numbers the probability that the first is bigger than the second is 1/2. By Lemma 1, E[Xij] = 1/2.
			We want the expected number of inverted pairs, so take the expectation of both sides:
			E(X) = E(Sum_i_from_1_to_n-1 Sum_j_from_1+1_to_n(Xij)) = n(n-1)/4
				
	21. 5.3-1 
		Professor Marceau objects to the loop invariant used in the proof of Lemma 5.5. He questions whether it is true prior to the first iteration. He reasons that we could just as easily declare that an empty subarray contains no 0-permutations. Therefore, the probability that an empty subarray contains a 0-permutation should be 0, thus invalidating the loop invariant prior to the first iteration. Rewrite the procedure RANDOMIZE-IN-PLACE so that its associated loop invariant applies to a nonempty subarray prior to the first iteration, and modify the proof of Lemma 5.5 for your procedure.
		
		Solution:

	22. 5.3-2
		Professor Kelp decides to write a procedure that produces at random any permutation besides the identity permutation. He proposes the following procedure:
			PERMUTE-WITHOUT-IDENTITY(A)
			1 n = A.length
			2 for i D 1 to n - 1
			3 	swap A[i] with A[RANDOM(i+1, n)]
		Does this code do what Professor Kelp intends?
		
		Solution:
			(2,3,..., n-1,n, 1) when RANDOM(i+1, n) returns i+1 always
			(2,3,..., n-1,n, 1) when RANDOM(2, n) return n and RANDOM(i+1, n) returns i+1 always
			

	23. 5.3-3
		Suppose that instead of swapping element A[i] with a random element from the subarray A[i..n], we swapped it with a random element from anywhere in the array:
		
			PERMUTE-WITH-ALL(A)
			1 n = A.length
			2 for i = 1 to n
			3 	swap A[i] with A[RANDOM(1,n)]
		Does this code produce a uniform random permutation? Why or why not?
		
		Solution:
		
	24. 5.3-4
		Professor Armstrong suggests the following procedure for generating a uniform random permutation:
			PERMUTE-BY-CYCLIC(A)
			1 n = A.length
			2 let B[1..n] be a new array
			3 offset = RANDOM(1, n)
			4 for i = 1 to n
			5 	dest = i + offset
			6 	if dest > n
			7 		dest = dest - n
			8 	B[dest] = A[i]
			9 return B
			
		Show that each element A[i] has a 1/n probability of winding up in any particular position in B. Then show that Professor Armstrong is mistaken by showing that the resulting permutation is not uniformly random.
		
	25. 5.3-5
		Prove that in the array P in procedure PERMUTE-BY-SORTING, the probability that all elements are unique is at least 1 - 1/n.
		
	26. 5.3-6
		Explain how to implement the algorithm PERMUTE-BY-SORTING to handle the case in which two or more priorities are identical. That is, your algorithm should produce a uniform random permutation, even if two or more priorities are identical.
		
	27. 5.3-7
		Suppose we want to create a random sample of the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n}, that is, an m-element subset S, where 0 <= m <= n, such that each m-subset is equally likely to be created. One way would be to set A[i] = i for i = 1, 2, 3, ...., n, call RANDOMIZE-IN-PLACE(A), and then take just the first m array elements. This method would make n calls to the RANDOM procedure. If n is much larger than m, we can create a random sample with fewer calls to RANDOM. Show that the following recursive procedure returns a random m-subset S of {1, 2, 3, ..., n}, in which each m-subset is equally likely, while making only m calls to RANDOM:
			RANDOM-SAMPLE(m, n)
			1 if m == 0
			2 	return {};
			3 else S = RANDOM-SAMPLE(m - 1, n - 1)
			4 	i = RANDOM(1, n)
			5 	if i IN S
			6 		S = S U {n}
			7 	else S = S U {i}
			8 	return S

	37. 6.1-1
		What are the minimum and maximum numbers of elements in a heap of height h?
		
		Solution:
			Maximum number of elements: 1 + 2 + 2^2 + .. + 2^h = 2^(h+1) - 1
			Mimum number of elements: 2^(h+1) - 1 - (2^h - 1) = 2^h = 2^h
	
	38. 6.1-2
		Show that an n-element heap has height floor(lg n).
		
		Solution:
			let the height is h, so from 6.1-1, we know 2^h <= n <= 2^(h+1) -1, so h<=lg n and  h>= lg(n + 1) -1, so h = floor( lg n )
				
	39. 6.1-3
		Show that in any subtree of a max-heap, the root of the subtree contains the largest value occurring anywhere in that subtree.
	
		Solution:
			A[PARENT(i)] >= A[i]
			
	40. 6.1-4
		Where in a max-heap might the smallest element reside, assuming that all elements are distinct?
		
		Solution:
			On leaves
			
	41. 6.1-5
		Is an array that is in sorted order a min-heap?
		
		Solution:
			Yes.  A[PARENT(i)] <= A[i], where PARENT(i) = floor(n/2)
		
	42. 6.1-6
		Is the array with values {23, 17, 14, 6, 13, 10, 1, 5, 7, 12} a max-heap?
		
		Solution:
			No. A[9] = 7, A[4] = 6, but A[4] < A[9]
		
	43. 6.1-7
		Show that, with the array representation for storing an n-element heap, the leaves are the nodes indexed by floor(n/2)+1,  floor(n/2)+2, ..., n.
		
		Solution:
		Prove, any node index >=floor(n/2)+1 must be a leaf. 
		(1). Assume there is a node with index i which i>=floor(n/2)+1 and it is not a leaf. So the node i must have a left and/or right left, then the left leaf's index is 2*i > 2*(floor(n/2)+1) > n, but there are only n elements, so it is not possible.
		(2). Assume there is anode whith index j, which j<=floor(n/2) and node j is a leaf. But because there is n-elements, the element n's parent must be the node with index floor(n/2). So it is not possible. 
		
	44. Heap sort algorithm
	
	45. 6.3-3
		Show that there are at most ceiling(n/2^(h+1)) nodes of height h in any n-element heap.
		
		Solution:
		See http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~kalpakis/Courses/441-sp03/hws/hw3-sol.pdf
		From the definition of max-heap, at depth d, there are at most 2^d nodes.
		PROOF: By induction on number of nodes at height h.
		
		Base case:
		Number of leaves at height h=0 is number of leaves in the n-element heap. Parent of the last node is the ceiling(n/2) node. This will be the last parent in the heap. All the nodes after this one will be leaves. So the number of leaves is ceiling(n/2). This is also true for the formula, therefor base case is true.

		We assume the number of nodes at height h-1 is given by the formula, ceiling(n/2^h).
		
		Note that if we remove all the leves from the heap, the nodes that were earlier at height now become leaves in the new heap, i.e. they have height 0. Similarly, all the nodes in the new tree will have height taht is one less than their old height. We shall use this to prove the induction.
		
		Induction: consider a new tree that is obtained by removing all the leaves from original heap. This tree is a heap with n-ceiling(n/2) nodes in it. The number of nodes at height h in the old heap willbe the same at the number of nodes at height h-1 in the new heap, which is (n-ceiling(n/2))/2^h = ceiling(n/2^(h+1))
		
		
	46. 6.4-2
		Argue the correctness of HEAPSORT using the following loop invariant: 
			At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 2每5, the subarray A[1..i] is a max-heap containing the i smallest elements of A[1..n], and the subarray A[i+1..n] contains the n-i largest elements of A[1..n], sorted.
			
		Solution:
			HEAPSORT(A)
			1	BUILD-MAX-HEAP(A)
			2	for i = A.length downto 2
			3		exchange A[1] with A[i]
			4		A.heap-size = A:heap-size - 1
			5		MAX-HEAPIFY(A, 1)
			
	47. 6.4-3
		What is the running time of HEAPSORT on an array A of length n that is already sorted in increasing order? What about decreasing order?
		
		Solution:
		When it is in increasing order:
			To build max-heap, time is O(n), worst case, every element need to be moved
			For line 2-5, need to loop n-2 times
				in each iteration, MAX-HEAPIFY take O(lg n)
		So Theta(n lg n)
			
		When it is in increasing order:
			To build max-heap, time is O(n), best case, no element need to be moved
		So Theta(n lg n)
			
	48. 6.4-4
		Show that the worst-case running time of HEAPSORT is BigOmega(n lg n).
	
	
	49. 6.4-5
		Show that when all elements are distinct, the best-case running time of HEAPSORT is BigOmega(n lg n).
		
	50. Priority queue code

	51. 6.5-4
		Why do we bother setting the key of the inserted node to -INFINITY in line 2 of MAXHEAP-INSERT when the next thing we do is increase its key to the desired value?

		Solution:
		To call HEAP-INCREASE-KEY(A , A.heap-size, key)
	
	52. 6.5-5
	53. 6.5-6
		Each exchange operation on line 5 of HEAP-INCREASE-KEY typically requires three assignments. Show how to use the idea of the inner loop of INSERTIONSORT to reduce the three assignments down to just one assignment.
		
			HEAP-INCREASE-KEY(A, i, key)
			1 if key < A[i]
			2 	error ※new key is smaller than current key§
			3 A[i] = key
			4 while i > 1 and A[PARENT(i)] < A[i]
			5 	exchange A[i] with A[PARENT(i)]
			6	i = PARENT(i)
			
		Solution:
			HEAP-INCREASE-KEY(A, i, key)
			1 if key < A[i]
			2 	error ※new key is smaller than current key§
			3 A[i] = key
			4 while PARENT(i) >= 0 and A[PARENT(i)] < key
			5 	A[i] = A[PARENT(i)]
			6	i = PARENT(i)
			7 A[i] = key

	54. 6.5-7
		Show how to implement a first-in, first-out queue with a priority queue. Show how to implement a stack with a priority queue.

		Solution:
			implementation is in code for 50. Priority queue code
			first-in, first-out queue: insertion time as the key and use MAX-HEAP algorithms
			stack: insertion time as the key and use MIN-HEAP algorithm

		
	55. 6.5-8
		The operation HEAP-DELETE(A, i) deletes the item in node i from heap A. Give an implementation of HEAP-DELETE that runs in O.lg n/ time for an n-element max-heap.
		
		HEAP-DELETE(A, i)
		1 	A[i] = A[A.length]
		2	A.length = A.length -1
		3	HEAP-MAXIFY(A, i)
		
	56. 6.5-9
		Given an O(n lg k)-time algorithm to merge k sorted lists into one sorted list, where n is the total number of elements in all the input lists. (Hint: Use a min-heap for k-way merging.)
		
		Solution1:
		An O(n lg k) algorithm for the problem is to pair the lists and merge each pair, and recursively merge thek=2 resulting lists. The time is given by the recurrence T(n, k) = O(n) + T(n, k/2), since the time to perform the merge for each pair of lists is proportional to the sum of the two sizes, so a constant amount of work is done per element. Then unwinding the recurrence gives lgk levels each with O(n) comparisons, for a total time of O(n lgk).
		
		Solution2:
		LOOP
			for the first element of the k lists to for heap B, do BUILD-MIN-HEAP(), takes O(k) < O(n) time
			pick B[1], which is the element of Ai list
			pick the first element from Ai's remaining elements and set to B[1]
			to B heap, do HEAP_MINIFY(B, 1)             takes O(lgk) time
		UNTILL NO items left in the k lists
		
	57. 6-1 Building a heap using insertion
		We can build a heap by repeatedly calling MAX-HEAP-INSERT to insert the elements into the heap. Consider the following variation on the BUILD-MAX-HEAP procedure:
		BUILD-MAX-HEAP'(A)
		1 A.heap-size = 1
		2 for i = 2 to A.length
		3 	MAX-HEAP-INSERT(A, A[i])
		
		a. Do the procedures BUILD-MAX-HEAP and BUILD-MAX-HEAP' always create the same heap when run on the same input array? Prove that they do, or provide a counterexample.

		b. Show that in the worst case, BUILD-MAX-HEAP' requires Theta(n lg n) time to build an n-element heap.
		
	58. 6-2
	59. 6-3 Young tableaus
		An m*n Young tableau is an m*n matrix such that the entries of each row are in sorted order from left to right and the entries of each column are in sorted order from top to bottom. Some of the entries of a Young tableau may be 1, which we treat as nonexistent elements. Thus, a Young tableau can be used to hold r <= mn finite numbers.
		
		a.

		c. Give an algorithm to implement EXTRACT-MIN on a nonempty mxn Young tableau that runs in O(m+n) time. Your algorithm should use a recursive subroutine that solves an mxn problem by recursively solving either an (m-1)*n or an m*(n-1) subproblem. (Hint: Think about MAXHEAPIFY.) Define T(p), where p = m + n, to be the maximum running time of EXTRACT-MIN on any m*n Young tableau. Give and solve a recurrence for T(p) that yields the O(m + n) time bound.
			
			Solution1:
			NOTE: (1,1) element is the minimum element of the table.
			
			Create a funtion to organize a sub-matrix as Young tableau. YOUNG_TABIFY_MAX_DOWN(A, i, j) tries to make A[i..A.height, j..A.length] to a Young Tableau which A[i..A.height, j+1..A.length] and A[i+1..A.height, j..A.length] are Young Tableau already.
			
			YOUNG_INCREASE(A, i, j, key) // push maximum value down....
			1	IF A[i, j] > key
			2		error "key is too small"
			3		RETURN
			4	A[i, j] = key
			5	(x, y) = (i, j)  // (x, y) contains the minimum value
			6	IF i+1<A.height AND A[i+1, j]<A[x, y]
			7		(x, y) = (i+1, j)
			8	IF j+1<A.length AND A[i, j+1]<A[x, y]
			9		(x, y) = (i, j+1)
			10	IF (x, y) != (i, j) // found the minimum element
			11		A[i, j] = A[x, y ]
			12		YOUNG_INCREASE(A, x, y, key)
			
			EXTRACT_MIN(A)
			1	min = A[1, 1]
			3	YOUNG_INCREASE(A, 1, 1, INFINITY) // push maxinum value down
			7	RETURN min
			
			For YOUNG_TABIFY(A, i, j), the sub-matrix has length m' and height n', let p' = m' + n', time for YOUNG_TABIFY(A, i, j) is T(p') = T(p'-1) + O(1), so T(p') = O(m' + n').
			SO for YOUNG_TABIFY(A, 1, 1), the time T(p) = O(m + n).
			In EXTRACT-MIN(A),
			Line 1 time is O(1)
			Line 2 time is O(m+n) 
			Line 3, 4 time is O(1),
			Lien 5 time is O(m+n)
			So the time is still O(m+n)
			

		d. Show how to insert a new element into a nonfull m*n Young tableau in O(m + n) time.
			
			Solution:
			YOUNG_DECREASE(A, i, j, key)

			2		error "new key is bigger than original"

		e. Using no other sorting method as a subroutine, show how to use an n*n Young tableau to sort n^2 numbers in O(n^3) time.

			Solution:
			Try to sort the items in a Young Tableau from left to right, from top to bottom.
			We assume when calling YOUNG_ORGANIZE(A, i, j), all the elements in A[x, y], x<i or x==i and y<=j are the smallest values in the whole Young Tableau already
			
			YOUNG_ORGANIZE(A, i, j)
			1	IF j+1<=A.length // Fill A[i, j+1] first
			2		IF i+1<=A.height AND A[i, j+1]>A[i+1, 1]
			3			maxvalue = A[i, j+1]

			For A(m, n), find A[m/2, n/2], based on this point, we can partition the YOUNG into pieces, and we can pick only two pieces.

		Banks often record transactions on an account in order of the times of the transactions, but many people like to receive their bank statements with checks listed in order by check number. People usually write checks in order by check number, and merchants usually cash them with reasonable dispatch. The problem of converting time-of-transaction ordering to check-number ordering is therefore the problem of sorting almost-sorted input. Argue that the procedure INSERTION-SORT would tend to beat the procedure QUICKSORT on this problem.

		Why do we analyze the expected running time of a randomized algorithm and not its worst-case running time?
		
		See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7896108/expected-running-time-vs-worst-case-running-time
		
		Answer1:
		When we say "expected running time", we are talking about the running time for the average case. We might be talking about an asymptotically upper or lower bound (or both). Similarly, we can talk about asymptotically upper and lower bounds on the running time of the best or worst cases. In other words, the bound is orthogonal to the case.

		In the case of randomized quicksort, people talk about the expected running time (O(n log n)) since this makes the algorithm seem better than worst-case O(n^2) algorithms (which it is, though not asymptotically in the worst case). In other words, randomized quicksort is much asymptotically faster than e.g. Bubblesort for almost all inputs, and people want a way to make that fact clear; so people emphasize the average-case running time of randomized quicksort, rather than the fact that it is as asymptotically bad as Bubblesort in the worst case.

		Answer2:
		Sometimes the expected running time means the average running time for a randomly chosen input. But if it's a randomized algorithm, then what is often meant is the expected running time with respect to the random choices made by the algorithm, for every input. That is what is meant here. For every input of n items, randomized quicksort runs in time O(n(log n)) on average, averaged only over its coin flips.

		In this limited sense, expected running time is a very defensible measure of the running time of a randomized algorithm. If you're only worried about the worst that could happen when the algorithm flips coins internally, then why bother flipping coins at all? You might as well just make them all heads. (Which in the case of randomized quicksort, would reduce it to ordinary quicksort.)

		Average case vs worst case is a much more serious matter when it's an average over inputs rather than an average over coin flips. In this case, the average running time is at best a figure that is not adaptable to changes in the type of input --- different uses of the algorithm could have different distributions of inputs. I say at best because you may not know that the hypothetical distribution of inputs is ever the true usage.

		Looking at the worst case with respect to coin flips only makes sense when you would both like to run quickly when your coin flips aren't unlucky, and not run too slowly even when your coin flips are unlucky. For instance, imagine that you need a sorting algorithm for the regulator for an oxygen supply (for a medical patient or a scuba diver). Then randomized quicksort would only make sense if you both want the result to be very fast usually, for the user's convenience, AND if the worst case wouldn't suffocate the user no matter what. This is a contrived scenario for sorting algorithms, because there are non-random sorting algorithms (like merge sort) that are not much slower than quicksort even is on average. It is less contrived for a problem like primality testing, where randomized algorithms are much faster than non-randomized algorithms. Then you might want to make a run for it with a randomized algorithm --- while at the same time running a non-randomized algorithm as a backup.

		(Okay, you might wonder why an oxygen regulator would want to know whether particular numbers are prime. Maybe it needs to communicate with a medical computer network, and the communication needs to be secure for medical privacy reasons...)
		
		

	72. 7.3-2 
		When RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT runs, how many calls are made to the randomnumber generator RANDOM in the worst case? How about in the best case? Give your answer in terms of Theta-notation.
		
		Solution:
		Worst case: Theta(n)
		Best case: Theta(n)
		
		http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~saunders/courses/621/03f/modelE.pdf

		RANDOM is called once for each time RANDOMIZED-PARTITION is called, so we can just consider the calls to RANDOMIZED-PARTITION by RANDOMIZEDQUICKSORT.
		
		The worst case behavior occurs when the partitioning produces one subproblem of size n-1 and one of size 0 each time it is called. The recurrence for the calls to RANDOMIZED-PARTITION is then T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(0) + Theta(1)
		T(0) = 0 because RANDOMIZED-PARTITION is not called on a subproblem of size 0, so T(n) = T(n = 1) + Theta(1)
		Therefore, in the worst case, T(n) = Theta(n).
		
		The best case occurs when the partitioning produces two subproblems of size at most n/2. It is at most this because one will have Floor(n/2} elements and one will have ceiting(n/2)-1. The recurrence for the calls to RANDOMIZED-PARTITION is then T(n) ≒ 2T(n/2) + Theta(1)
			By case 1 of the Master Theorem, T(n) has the solution T(n) = Theta(n) in the best case.
	
		So, Theta(n) calls are made to RANDOM in the best and worst cases

		The next three questions ask you to give a careful argument that the procedure HOARE-PARTITION is correct. Assuming that the subarray A[p..r] contains at least two elements, prove the following:
		
		b. The indices i and j are such that we never access an element of A outside the subarray A[p..r].
			Solution:
			The loop invariant for loop 4 ~ 13 is:
				A[p..i] <= A[p]
				A[j..r] >= A[p]
				A[i+1..j-1] is not defined

		c. When HOARE-PARTITION terminates, it returns a value j such that p <= j < r.
		
		d. Every element of A[p..j] is less than or equal to every element of A[j+1..r] when HOARE-PARTITION terminates.
		
		The PARTITION procedure in Section 7.1 separates the pivot value (originally in A[r]) from the two partitions it forms. The HOARE-PARTITION procedure, on the other hand, always places the pivot value (originally in A[p]) into one of the two partitions A[p..j] and A[j+1..r]. Since p <= j < r, this split is always nontrivial.

	86. 7-6 Fuzzy sorting of intervals
		Consider a sorting problem in which we do not know the numbers exactly. Instead, for each number, we know an interval on the real line to which it belongs. That is, we are given n closed intervals of the form [ai, bi], where ai <= bi. We wish to fuzzy-sort these intervals, i.e., to produce a permutation <i1, i2, ... , in> of the intervals such that for j = 1, 2, ..., n, there exist cj IN [aij , bij] satisfying c1 <= c2 <= ... <= cn.

		a. 
		Design a randomized algorithm for fuzzy-sorting n intervals. Your algorithm should have the general structure of an algorithm that quicksorts the left endpoints (the ai values), but it should take advantage of overlapping intervals to improve the running time. (As the intervals overlap more and more, the problem of fuzzy-sorting the intervals becomes progressively easier. Your algorithm should take advantage of such overlapping, to the extent that it exists.)

By taking logarithms, h >= lg (n!/2^n) = lg (n!) 每 n =  Theta (n lg n) 每 n =  Theta(n lg n). Thus, there is no comparison sort whose running time is linear for a fraction of 1/2^n of the n! inputs of length n.
		
	90. 8.1-4
		Suppose that you are given a sequence of n elements to sort. The input sequence consists of n/k subsequences, each containing k elements. The elements in a given subsequence are all smaller than the elements in the succeeding subsequence and larger than the elements in the preceding subsequence. Thus, all that is needed to sort the whole sequence of length n is to sort the k elements in each of the n/k subsequences. Show an Omaga(n lg k) lower bound on the number of comparisons needed to solve this variant of the sorting problem. (Hint: It is not rigorous to simply combine the lower bounds for the individual subsequences.)
	
	91. Counting sort
		Counting sort sorts n elements that every element value is 0<=e<=k
		
		// COUNTING_SORT sorts the elements in array A, and put the result in array B. All elements in array A are between 0 and k. 
		COUNTING_SORT(A, B, k)
		1	Let C[0..k] be a new array
		2	// Initialize array C
		3	FOR i=0 TO k
		4		C[i] = 0
		5	// for each value 0 ~ k, calculate how many appears in array A
		6	FOR j=1 TO A.length
		7		C[A[j]] += 1
		8	// for each value 0 ~ k, calculate how many elements equals to or less than it in array A
		9	FOR i=1 to k
		10		C[i] = C[i] + C[i+1]
		11	// put value to array B
		12	FOR j=A.length TO 1
		13		B[C[A[j]]] = A[j]
		14		C[A[j]] -= 1

		We are given n points in the unit circle, pi = (xi, yi), such that 0 < xi**2 + yi**2 <= 1 for i=1, 2, ...,n. Suppose that the points are uniformly distributed; that is, the probability of finding a point in any region of the circle is proportional to the area of that region. Design an algorithm with an average-case running time of theta(n) to sort the n points by their distances di = sqrt(xi**2 + yi**2) from the origin. (Hint: Design the bucket sizes in BUCKET-SORT to reflect the uniform distribution of the points in the unit circle.)
		
		Solution:
		Use bucket sorting. 
		Divide the unit circle into 10 pieces and each piece has area .1 from the origin. Accordingly the distances for each area from edge to origion are d1, d2, ..., d10.

	106. 8-1 Probabilistic lower bounds on comparison sorting
		In this problem, we prove a probabilistic Omega(n lg n) lower bound on the running time of any deterministic or randomized comparison sort on n distinct input elements. We begin by examining a deterministic comparison sort A with decision tree TA. We assume that every permutation of A＊s inputs is equally likely.
		
		a. Suppose that each leaf of TA is labeled with the probability that it is reached given a random input. Prove that exactly n! leaves are labeled 1/n! and that the rest are labeled 0.

		d. Give an algorithm that k-sorts an n-element array in O(n lg(n/k)) time.
		Solution:
		(1). Divide the n elements into n/k groups, and there are k elements in each group. A1, A2, ... , An/k.
		(2). Consider the n/k elements (A1i, A2i, ..., An/k i), where i=1,2,...,k. Sort it in Theta((n/k)*lg(n/k)) times, use any good sorting algorithm
		(3). so the total time is Theta(k*(n/k)*lg(n/k)) = Theta(n lg(n/k))

			["aa","b"],
			["a","a","b"]
		  ]
	3. Surrounded Regions
		Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
		A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region .

		For example,
			X X X X
			X O O X
			X X O X
			X O X X
		After running your function, the board should be:

			X X X X
			X X X X
			X X X X
			X O X X
	4. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
		Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.
		An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.
		Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.
		For example,

			1
		   / \
		  2   3
		The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
		The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.

		Return the sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
	
	5. Longest Consecutive Sequence
		Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

		Return
		  [
			["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
			["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
		  ]
		Note:
		All words have the same length.
		All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.

	7. Word Ladder
		Given two words (start and end), and a dictionary, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from start to end, such that:

		Only one letter can be changed at a time
		Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary
		For example,

		Given:
		start = "hit"
		end = "cog"
		dict = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
		As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
		return its length 5.

		Note:
		Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
		All words have the same length.
		All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
		
	8. Valid Palindrome
		Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

		For example,
		"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
		"race a car" is not a palindrome.

		Note:
		Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.

		For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

		For example,
		"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
		"race a car" is not a palindrome.

		Note:
		Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.

		For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

	9. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
		Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
		The path may start and end at any node in the tree.
		For example:

			  / \
			 2   3
		Return 6.
	10. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
		Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

		Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

		Note:
		You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
		
	11. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
		Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

		Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times). However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
		
	12. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
		Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
		If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
		
	13. Triangle
		Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

		For example, given the following triangle
		[
			 [2],
			[3,4],
		   [6,5,7],
		  [4,1,8,3]
		]
		The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).

		Note:
		Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n is the total number of rows in the triangle.	
	
	14. Pascal's Triangle II
		Given an index k, return the kth row of the Pascal's triangle.

		Note:
		Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?
		
	15. Pascal's Triangle
		Given numRows, generate the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

		For example, given numRows = 5,
		Return

		[
			 [1],
			[1,1],
		   [1,2,1],
		  [1,3,3,1],
		 [1,4,6,4,1]
		]

	16. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II
		Follow up for problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node".

		What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?

		Note:

		You may only use constant extra space.
		For example,
		Given the following binary tree,
				 1
			   /  \
			  2    3
			 / \    \
			4   5    7
		After calling your function, the tree should look like:
				 1 -> NULL
			   /  \
			  2 -> 3 -> NULL
			 / \    \
			4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
		
	17. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
		Given a binary tree

			struct TreeLinkNode {
			  TreeLinkNode *left;
			  TreeLinkNode *right;
			  TreeLinkNode *next;
			}
		Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

		Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

		Note:

		You may only use constant extra space.
		You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).
		For example,
		Given the following perfect binary tree,
				 1
			   /  \
			  2    3
			 / \  / \
			4  5  6  7
		After calling your function, the tree should look like:
				 1 -> NULL
			   /  \
			  2 -> 3 -> NULL
			 / \  / \
			4->5->6->7 -> NULL
	
	18. Distinct Subsequences
		Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of T in S.

		A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

		Here is an example:
		S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"

		Return 3.

	19. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List
		Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

		For example,
		Given

				 1
				/ \
			   2   5
			  / \   \
			 3   4   6
		The flattened tree should look like:
		   1
			\
			 2
			  \
			   3
				\
				 4
				  \
				   5
					\
					 6	
					 
	20. Path Sum
		Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

		For example:
		Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,
					  5
					 / \
					4   8
				   /   / \
				  11  13  4
				 /  \      \
				7    2      1
		return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.
		
	21. Path Sum II
		Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

		For example:
		Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,
					  5
					 / \
					4   8
				   /   / \
				  11  13  4
				 /  \    / \
				7    2  5   1
		return
		[
		   [5,4,11,2],
		   [5,8,4,5]
		]

	22. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
		Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
		The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.
		
	23. Balanced Binary Tree
		Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
		For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

	25. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree
		Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.
	
	26. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II
		Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

		For example:
		Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},
			3
		   / \
		  9  20
			/  \
		   15   7
		return its bottom-up level order traversal as:
		[
		  [15,7]
		  [9,20],
		  [3],
		]
		confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means? 


	27. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal
		Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.
		Note:
		You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.
		
	28. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
		Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.
		Note:
		You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.	
		
	29. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
		Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
		The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
	
	30. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal
		Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).
		For example:
		Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},
			3
		   / \
		  9  20
			/  \
		   15   7
		return its zigzag level order traversal as:
		[
		  [3],
		  [20,9],
		  [15,7]
		]

		OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:
		The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

		Here's an example:
		   1
		  / \
		 2   3
			/
		   4
			\
			 5
		The above binary tree is serialized as "{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}".
		
	31. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
		Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

		For example:
		Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},
			3
		   / \
		  9  20
			/  \
		   15   7
		return its level order traversal as:
		[
		  [3],
		  [9,20],

		  / \
		 2   3
			/
		   4
			\
			 5
		The above binary tree is serialized as "{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}".
		
	32. Symmetric Tree
		Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

		For example, this binary tree is symmetric:

			1
		   / \
		  2   2
		 / \ / \
		3  4 4  3
		But the following is not:
			1
		   / \
		  2   2
		   \   \
		   3    3
		Note:
		Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
		
	33. Same Tree
		Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not.
		Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.


	34. Recover Binary Search Tree
		Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.
		Recover the tree without changing its structure.
		Note:
		A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?


	35. Validate Binary Search Tree
		Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
		Assume a BST is defined as follows:
			The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
			The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
			Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
			
	36. Interleaving String
		Given s1, s2, s3, find whether s3 is formed by the interleaving of s1 and s2.

		For example,
		Given:
		s1 = "aabcc",
		s2 = "dbbca",

		When s3 = "aadbbcbcac", return true.
		When s3 = "aadbbbaccc", return false.
		
	37. Unique Binary Search Trees II
		Given n, generate all structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1...n.
		For example,
		Given n = 3, your program should return all 5 unique BST's shown below.

		   1         3     3      2      1
			\       /     /      / \      \
			 3     2     1      1   3      2
			/     /       \                 \
		   2     1         2                 3
		   
	38. Unique Binary Search Trees
		Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1...n?
		For example,
		Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's.

		   1         3     3      2      1
			\       /     /      / \      \
			 3     2     1      1   3      2
			/     /       \                 \
		   2     1         2                 3
		   
	39. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
		Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.
		For example:
		Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},
		   1
			\
			 2
			/
		   3
		return [1,3,2].
		Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
		
	40. Restore IP Addresses
		Given a string containing only digits, restore it by returning all possible valid IP address combinations.
		For example:
		Given "25525511135",
		return ["255.255.11.135", "255.255.111.35"]. (Order does not matter)

	41. Reverse Linked List II
		Reverse a linked list from position m to n. Do it in-place and in one-pass.

		For example:
		Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, m = 2 and n = 4,

		return 1->4->3->2->5->NULL.

		Note:
		Given m, n satisfy the following condition:
		1 ? m ? n ? length of list.
   
	42. Subsets II
		Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, S, return all possible subsets.

		Note:
		Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
		The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
		For example,
		If S = [1,2,2], a solution is:

		[
		  [2],
		  [1],
		  [1,2,2],
		  [2,2],
		  [1,2],
		  []
		]
	
	43. Decode Ways
		A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

		'A' -> 1
		'B' -> 2
		...
		'Z' -> 26
		Given an encoded message containing digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

		For example,
		Given encoded message "12", it could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

		The number of ways decoding "12" is 2.
	44. Gray Code
		The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

		Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

		For example, given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:

		00 - 0
		01 - 1
		11 - 3
		10 - 2
		Note:
		For a given n, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.

		For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.

		For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.

	45. Merge Sorted Array
		Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.
		Note:
		You may assume that A has enough space to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.
	
	46. Scramble String
		Given a string s1, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.

		Below is one possible representation of s1 = "great":

			great
		   /    \
		  gr    eat
		 / \    /  \
		g   r  e   at
				   / \
				  a   t
		To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.

		For example, if we choose the node "gr" and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string "rgeat".

			rgeat
		   /    \
		  rg    eat
		 / \    /  \
		r   g  e   at
				   / \
				  a   t
		We say that "rgeat" is a scrambled string of "great".

		Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes "eat" and "at", it produces a scrambled string "rgtae".

			rgtae
		   /    \
		  rg    tae
		 / \    /  \
		r   g  ta  e
			   / \
			  t   a
		We say that "rgtae" is a scrambled string of "great".

		Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, determine if s2 is a scrambled string of s1.

	47. Partition List
		Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

		You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

		For example,
		Given 1->4->3->2->5->2 and x = 3,
		return 1->2->2->4->3->5.

	48. Maximal Rectangle
		Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing all ones and return its area.


	49. Largest Rectangle in Histogram
		Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

		       _
		     _| |
		    | | |
		    | | |  _
		 _  | | |_| |
		| |_| | | | |
		| | | | | | |

		Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].
		The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.
		For example,
		Given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3],
		return 10.
		
		There is a histogram with integer heights and constant width 1. I want to maximize the rectangular area under a histogram. e.g.:
		 _
		| |
		| |_ 
		|   |
		|   |_
		|     |
		
		The answer for this would be 6, 3 * 2, using col1 and col2.
		O(n^2) brute force is clear to me, I would like an O(n log n) algorithm. I'm trying to think dynamic programming along the lines of maximum increasing subsequence O(n log n) algo, but am not going forward. Should I use divide and conquer algorithm?
		PS: People with enough reputation are requested to remove the divide-and-conquer tag if there is no such solution.
		After mho's comments: I mean the area of largest rectangle that fits entirely. (Thanks j_random_hacker for clarifying :) ).

	50. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II
		Given a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list.
		For example,
		Given 1->2->3->3->4->4->5, return 1->2->5.
		Given 1->1->1->2->3, return 2->3.

	51. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
		Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.
		For example,
		Given 1->1->2, return 1->2.
		Given 1->1->2->3->3, return 1->2->3.

	52. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
		Follow up for "Search in Rotated Sorted Array":
		What if duplicates are allowed?
		Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
		Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.

	53. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II
		Follow up for "Remove Duplicates":
		What if duplicates are allowed at most twice?

		For example,
		Given sorted array A = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

		Your function should return length = 5, and A is now [1,1,2,2,3].

	54. Word Search
		Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

		The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

		For example,
		Given board =

		[
		  ["ABCE"],
		  ["SFCS"],
		  ["ADEE"]
		]
		word = "ABCCED", -> returns true,
		word = "SEE", -> returns true,
		word = "ABCB", -> returns false.

	55. Subsets
		Given a set of distinct integers, S, return all possible subsets.
		Note:
		Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
		The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
		For example,
		If S = [1,2,3], a solution is:

		[
		  [3],
		  [1],
		  [2],
		  [1,2,3],
		  [1,3],
		  [2,3],
		  [1,2],
		  []
		]

	56. Combinations
		Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers out of 1 ... n.

		For example,
		If n = 4 and k = 2, a solution is:

		[
		  [2,4],
		  [3,4],
		  [2,3],
		  [1,2],
		  [1,3],
		  [1,4],
		]

	57. Minimum Window Substring
		Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

		For example,
		S = "ADOBECODEBANC"
		T = "ABC"
		Minimum window is "BANC".

		Note:
		If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the emtpy string "".

		If there are multiple such windows, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.

	58. Sort Colors
		Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

		Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

		Note:
		You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

		Follow up:
		A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
		First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.

		Could you come up with an one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

	59. Search a 2D Matrix
		Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

		Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
		The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
		For example,

		Consider the following matrix:

		[
		  [1,   3,  5,  7],
		  [10, 11, 16, 20],
		  [23, 30, 34, 50]
		]
		Given target = 3, return true.
	
	60. Set Matrix Zeroes
		Given a m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in place.
		Follow up:
		Did you use extra space?
		A straight forward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
		A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
		Could you devise a constant space solution?

	61. Edit Distance
		Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)
		You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
		a) Insert a character
		b) Delete a character
		c) Replace a character
	62. Simplify Path
		Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it.
		For example,
		path = "/home/", => "/home"
		path = "/a/./b/../../c/", => "/c"
	
	63. Climbing Stairs
		You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
		Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
		
	64. Sqrt(x)
		Implement int sqrt(int x).
		Compute and return the square root of x.	

	65. Text Justification
		Given an array of words and a length L, format the text such that each line has exactly L characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

		You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly L characters.

		Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

		For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.

		For example,

		 [ 7, 6, 5 ]
		]
	
	76. Length of Last Word

		For example, 
		Given s = "Hello World",
		return 5.
	
	77. Insert Interval
		Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).
		You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.
		
		Example 1:
		Given intervals [1,3],[6,9], insert and merge [2,5] in as [1,5],[6,9].

		Example 2:
		Given [1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16], insert and merge [4,9] in as [1,2],[3,10],[12,16].

		This is because the new interval [4,9] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
	
	78. Merge Intervals

		For example,
		Given [1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18],

		Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

		Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

		For example,
		There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle:

		[
		 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
		  "...Q",
		  "Q...",
		  "..Q."],

		 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
		  "Q...",

		[1,1,2], [1,2,1], and [2,1,1].

	88. Permutations
		Given a collection of numbers, return all possible permutations.

		For example,
		[1,2,3] have the following permutations:
		[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].
	
	89. Jump Game II
		Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

		Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

		Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

		For example:
		Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]

		The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)

	90. Wildcard Matching
		Implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*'.

		'?' Matches any single character.
		'*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

		The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

		The function prototype should be:

		The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times
		Note:
		All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
		Elements in a combination (a1, a2, .. , ak) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a1 <= a2 <= ... <= ak).
		The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
		For example, given candidate set 2,3,6,7 and target 7, 
		A solution set is: 
		[7] 
		[2, 2, 3] 

	96. Count and Say
		The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
		1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...

		1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.

		[1,3,5,6], 2 ↙ 1
		[1,3,5,6], 7 ↙ 4
		[1,3,5,6], 0 ↙ 0

	100. Search for a Range
		Given a sorted array of integers, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

		Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

		If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

		For example,
		Given [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10] and target value 8,
		return [3, 4].

	101. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
		Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

	108. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
		Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
		Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

		Your function should return length = 2, and A is now [1,2].
		
	109. Reverse Nodes in k-Group
		Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.
		If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.
		You may not alter the values in the nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
		Only constant memory is allowed.
		For example,
		Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5
		For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5
		For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5

	110. Swap Nodes in Pairs
		Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
		For example,
		Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.

	114. Remove Nth Node From End of List
		Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.
		For example,
			Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
			After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
		Note:
		Given n will always be valid.

		[image]
		Input:Digit string "23"
		Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].

	116. 4Sum
		Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c, and d in S such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.
		Note:
		Elements in a quadruplet (a,b,c,d) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a ? b ? c ? d)
		The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.
			For example, given array S = {1 0 -1 0 -2 2}, and target = 0.

			A solution set is:
			(-1,  0, 0, 1)
			(-2, -1, 1, 2)

	117. 3Sum Closest
		Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
			For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.
			The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
	
	118. 3Sum
		Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

		Note:

Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

		Note: You may not slant the container.

	123. Regular Expression Matching
		Implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.

		'.' Matches any single character.
		'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

		The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

		The function prototype should be:
		bool isMatch(const char *s, const char *p)

		Some examples:
		isMatch("aa","a") ? false
		isMatch("aa","aa") ? true
		isMatch("aaa","aa") ? false
		isMatch("aa", "a*") ? true
		isMatch("aa", ".*") ? true
		isMatch("ab", ".*") ? true
		isMatch("aab", "c*a*b") ? true


	124. Palindrome Number
		Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.
		Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)
		If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.
		You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?
		There is a more generic way of solving this problem.
		
	125. String to Integer (atoi)
		Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.
		Hint: Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.
		Notes: It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front.

		Requirements for atoi:
		The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

		The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

		If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

		If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned. If the correct value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2147483647) or INT_MIN (-2147483648) is returned.
		
	126. Reverse Integer
		Reverse digits of an integer.

		Example1: x = 123, return 321
		Example2: x = -123, return -321

		Have you thought about this?
		Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!

		If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.

		Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?

		Throw an exception? Good, but what if throwing an exception is not an option? You would then have to re-design the function (ie, add an extra parameter).
	
	127. ZigZag Conversion
		The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

		P   A   H   N
		A P L S I I G
		Y   I   R
		And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
		Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

		string convert(string text, int nRows);
		convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".

	128. Longest Palindromic Substring
		Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S. You may assume that the maximum length of S is 1000, and there exists one unique longest palindromic substring.

	129. Add Two Numbers
		You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

		Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
		Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

	130. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
		Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. For example, the longest substring without repeating letters for "abcabcbb" is "abc", which the length is 3. For "bbbbb" the longest substring is "b", with the length of 1.


	131. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
		There are two sorted arrays A and B of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
		
	132. Two Sum
		Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

		The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

		You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

		Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
		Output: index1=1, index2=2

		An array A contains all the integers from 0 to n, except for one number which is missing. In this problem, we cannot access an entire integer in A with a single operation. The elements of A are represented in binary, and the only operation we can use to access them is "fetch the jth bit of A[i]," which takes constant time. Write code to find the missing integer. Can you do it in 0(n) time?

		Oh, no! You have just completed a lengthy document when you have an unfortunate Find/Replace mishap. You have accidentally removed all spaces, punctuation,
		and capitalization in the document. A sentence like "I reset the computer. It still didn't boot!"would become"iresetthecomputeritstilldidntboot". You figure that you can add back in the punctation and capitalization later, once you get the individual words properly separated. Most of the words will be in a dictionary, but some strings, like proper names, will not. Given a dictionary (a list of words), design an algorithm to find the optimal way of "unconcatenating"a sequence of words. In this case, "optimal" is defined to be the parsing which minimizes the number of unrecognized sequences of characters.
		For example, the string "jesslookedjustliketimherbrother" would be optimally parsed as "JESS looked just like TIM her brother". This parsing has seven unrecognized characters, which we have capitalized for clarity.

		17.5 The Game of Master Mind is played as follows:
			The computer has four slots, and each slot will contain a ball that is red (R), yellow (Y), green (G) or blue (B). For example, the computer might have RGGB {Slot #1 is red, Slots #2 and #3 are green, Slot #4 is blue). You, the user, are trying to guess the solution. You might, for example, guess YRGB.
			When you guess the correct color for the correct slot, you get a "hit." If you guess a color that exists but is in the wrong slot, you get a "pseudo-hit." Note that a slot that is a hit can never count as a pseudo-hit. For example, if the actual solution is RGBY and you guess GGRR, you have one hit and one pseudo-hit.

		17.10 Since XML is very verbose, you are given a way of encoding it where each tag gets mapped to a pre-defined integer value. The language/grammar is as follows:
			Element --> Tag Attributes END Children END
			Attribute --> Tag Value
			END --> 0
			Tag --> some predefined mapping to int
			Value --> string value END

			For example, the following XML might be converted into the compressed string below (assuming a mapping of family -> 1, person ->2, firstName ->3, lastName -> 4, state -> 5).
			<family lastName="McDowell" state="CA">
			<person firstName="Gayle">Some Message</person>
			</family>
			Becomes:

		17.14 Oh, no! You have just completed a lengthy document when you have an unfortunate Find/Replace mishap. You have accidentally removed all spaces, punctuation, and capitalization in the document. A sentence like "I reset the computer. It still didn't boot!"would become"iresetthecomputeritstilldidntboot". You figure that you can add back in the punctation and capitalization later, once you get the individual words properly separated. Most of the words will be in a dictionary, but some strings, like proper names, will not. Given a dictionary (a list of words), design an algorithm to find the optimal way of "unconcatenating"a sequence of words. In this case, "optimal" is defined to be the parsing which minimizes the number of unrecognized sequences of characters. For example, the string "jesslookedjustliketimherbrother" would be optimally parsed as "JESS looked just like TIM her brother". This parsing has seven unrecognized characters, which we have capitalized for clarity.

		The median of M numbers is defined as the middle number after sorting them in order if M is odd or the average number of the middle 2 numbers (again after sorting) if M is even. You have an empty number list at first. Then you can add or remove some number from the list. For each add or remove operation, output the median of numbers in the list.

	11. Interview Question - mitbbs
		Interview Question 每 Given a set of Sentences containing lower case letters only, remove common phrases from each sentence. Here a phrase is defined by 3 or more consecutive words.
		E.g:
			S1 = "I my bye good";
			S2 = "my bye good boy";
		common phrase is: "my bye good"
		so the two sentence become
			S1 = "I";
			s2 ="boy";

		How about the following input ? 
			S1 = "q a b c d a b c b c d e" 
			S2 = "a b c d e"
		What's the output? Is it ok to the following output? 
			S1 = "q" 
			S2 = ""
		Yup, your output is correct. This is because there are three common phrases,
		ie: 
			"a b c d", 
			"a b c", 
			and "b c d e".

	14. ADS-80 (Two interview questions from Box) Mar. 21 2013
		Both are design questions. No ZZ, thanks:)

		Q1. At Box we have several severs dealing with queries from different APIs. For example, 3 servers one serving PHP, one serving Mobile, one serving etc. All 3 servers will generate read and write requests to Box's central database. Among these servers, there's a memcached distributed cache system to deal with frequent requests. If the cache is missed, the request will be redirected to the database. The question is,

		if multiple servers is writing to the database, formulate a strategy so that there is an EVENTUAL CONSISTENCY between the memcache and the database. Note, scaling is very important. There could be thousands servers writing to the cache / database at the same time.

				S1  S2  S3
				  \   |   /
				memcache
					  |
				database (SQL)


		Q2. There is a new building of 50 stories high, design an elevator system with 4 elevators in total. Write out the main objects AND code up an efficient elevator scheduling module.

	18. Lego Blocks
		You have 4 types of lego blocks, of sizes 1 * 1 * 1, 1 * 1 * 2, 1 * 1 * 3 and 1 * 1 * 4. Assume you have infinite number of blocks of each type.
		You want to make a wall of height N and width M out of these blocks. The wall should not have any holes in it. The wall you build should be one solid structure. A solid structure means that it should not be possible to separate the wall along any vertical line without cutting any lego block used to build the wall. The blocks can only be placed horizontally. In how many ways can the wall be built?

		Input:
		The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. Each case contains two integers N and M.

		Output:
		Output T lines, one for each test case containing the number of ways to build the wall. As the numbers can be very large, output the result modulo 1000000007.

		Constraints:
		1 <= T <= 100
		1 <= N,M <= 1000

		Sample Input:
		4
		2 2
		3 2
		2 3
		4 4

		Sample Output:
		3
		7
		9
		3375

		Explanation:
		For the first case, the possible walls are:

		aa
		bc

		aa
		bb

		ab
		cc

		For the second case, each row of the wall can contain either two blocks of width 1, or one block of width 2. However, the wall where all rows contain two blocks of width 1 is not a solid one as it can be divided vertically. Thus the number of ways is 2 * 2 * 2 - 1 = 7.

		PS:§aa§ is one lego block of size 1 * 1 * 2, ※b§ and ※c§ are lego blocks of size 1 * 1 * 1.

	19. Cards flip
		Q: one deck of card having 10 upside down cards in dark room, how to separate the deck to 2 piles which have the same upside down cards
		A: separate them to 10 and 42 (if one deck has 52 cards). then flip all the 10 cards. now you have equal number of upside cards

	23. how would you implement a hastable
		1) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9409699/hashtable-implementation
		Hash tables have two main possibilities:
		Open Addressing, which is a simple array [dynamic array actualy if you can let your table grow on the fly]. Once a conflict has met - you need to use a second hash function to find the next entree that the element will be mapped to. Note this solution has some troubles [which can be solved] when your hash table also allows deletions. [Special mark for "deleted" entrees]
		Chaining - in this solution, each entree in the array is a linked list - containig all elements hashed to this entree. In here - all elements mapped to a certain value are in the list.
		The important part about hash tables [in both solutions] in order to allow armotorized O(1) insert/del/look up - is allocating a bigger table and rehashing once a pre defined load factor was reached.

		EDIT: complexity analsis: 
		Assume a load factor of p for some p < 1.

		The probability of "collision" in each access is p Thus the mean of array accesses is: Sigma(i * p^(i-1) * (1-p)) for each i in [1,n] This gives you: Sigma(i * p^(i-1) * (1-p)) = (1-p) * Sigma(i * p^(i-1)) <= (1-p) * 1/(p-1)^2 = 1-p = CONST. [have a look at the correctness of Sigma(i * p^(i-1)) < 1/(p-1)^2 in wolfram alpha]. Thus resulting on average a constant number of accesses to the array. Also: You might need to rehash all elements after the load factor was reached, resulting in O(n) accesses to the array. This results in n * O(1) ops [adding n elements] and 1 * O(n) op [rehashing], so you get: (n * O(1) + 1 * O(n)) / n = O(1) armotorized time.
		Very similar to (1), but the analysis is done on list accesses. Each operation requires exactly one array accesses, and a variant number of list accesses - with the same analysis as before.

		This one is from one of my onsite interview questions. No reposting please.
		For a simple graph with nodes colored either black or white. The requirement is that for each black node all its neighbors have to be white, and vice versa. Write a code to determine if a given graph is legitimate.
		Follow up, for a given topology of a Graph, determine if this graph can be colored by black and white using the rules described blow.

		Given a Binary Tree, find size of the Largest Independent Set(LIS) in it. A subset of all tree nodes is an independent set if there is no edge between any two nodes of the subset.
		For example, consider the following binary tree. The largest independent set(LIS) is {10, 40, 60, 70, 80} and size of the LIS is 5.
		
		Use DP. 
		struct TreeNode {
			int value;
			TreeNode *left; 
			TreeNode *right;
		}
		unorder_map<TreeNode *> LIS;
		int calculate(int root, unorder_map<TreeNode *> &LIS) {
			if(!root)
				return 0;
			
			if(LIS.find(root) != LIS.end())
				return LIS[root];
				
			if(!root->left && !root->right) {
				LIS[root] = 1;
				return LIS[root];
			}
			// case 1. Not including root
			int num1 = calculate(root->left, LIS) + calculate(root->right, LIS);
			//case 2. Including root
			// 2.1 To left child
			int num2 = 1;
			if(root->left) {
				num2 +=  calculate(root->left->left, LIS) + calculate(root->left->right, LIS);
			}
			if(root->right) {
				num2 +=  calculate(root->right->left, LIS) + calculate(root->right->right, LIS);

			LIS[root] = max(num1, num2);

	38. Shuffle strings
		We are given 3 strings: str1, str2, and str3. Str3 is said to be a shuffle of str1 and str2 if it can be formed by interleaving the characters of str1 and str2 in a way that maintains the left to right ordering of the characters from each string. For example, given str1=§abc§ and str2=§def§, str3=§dabecf§ is a valid shuffle since it preserves the character ordering of the two strings. So, given these 3 strings write a function that detects whether str3 is a valid shuffle of str1 and str2.
		
		vector<vecotor<bool> > M(m+1, vector<bool>(n+1, false));
		M[i][j] = 	true, if i==0 && j==0
					str3[i+j-1]==str1[i-1] && M[i-1][j] || str3[i+j-1]==str2[j-1] && M[i][j-1]
		return M[m][n]

		*. compute cubic root of float X;
		*. Two sum.
		*. check whether two input trees are mirror to each other.
		*. check whether a binary tree is a BST.
		*. design OOD for zoo, including cage and animals.
		*. Google gmail server location question; why it is still fast when moving from 1 place to another.

		/** Compute the value of an expression in Reverse Polish order. Supported operators are "+", "-", "*" and "/".
		* Reverse Polish is a postfix mathematical notation in which each operator immediately follows its operands.
		* Each operand may be a number or another expression.
		* For example, 3 + 4 in Reverse Polish is 3 4 + and 2 * (4 + 1) would be written as 4 1 + 2 * or 2 4 1 + *
		*
		* @param ops a sequence of numbers and operators, in Reverse Polish order
		* @return the result of the computation
		* @throws IllegalArgumentException ops don't represent a well-formed RPN
		expression
		* @throws ArithmeticException the computation generates an arithmetic error
		, such as dividing by zero
		*
		* <p>Some sample ops and their results:
		* ["4", "1", "+", "2.5", "*"] -> ((4 + 1) * 2.5) -> 12.5
		* ["5", "80", "40", "/", "+"] -> (5 + (80 / 40)) ->  7

		Please submit solutions to the following two Java programming questions.
		Feel free to use standard Java APIs in your solutions and also to compile/
		test
		your code. However, the solutions should represent your own original work.

		We will be examining your solutions for correctness, efficiency, and 
		good programming practice.

		QUESTION #1:

		Write a Java method that takes an array of "sets" of String objects,
		and determines whether _all_ sets in the array are equivalent.

		Each "set" in the input array is represented as an array of String objects, 
		in 
		no particular order, and possibly containing duplicates. Nevertheless, when
		determining whether two of these "sets" are equivalent, you should disregard
		order and duplicates. For example, the sets represented by these arrays are
		all equivalent:

		{"a", "b"}

	78. ADS-90 (Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000, Google interview ) Apr. 30, 2013 
		Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

		1. 

		Piece is a general interface, which can be implemented as concrete types, 
		interface may include possible moves given the settings on board (arguable);
		getter for name; getter for display configuration (arguable); color... 

		Board will store and manage positions of all Pieces. Sierialization may be 
		required since users could save and resume games. Board provides methods to 
		move, change, remove, add (for undo) pieces by name/reference/position/
		enumeration. 

		Use patterns like builder pattern to generate a board setting.

		Players class will store basic information about time remaining, history win
		/lose data, and color assigned.

		Then GameController. Though I believe most of the logics should go here, I 
		personally tend to put basic movement logics in Piece. This Controller 
		should include high level game logics and rules, like: receive Commands to 
		select piece, return positions that Piece can be moved to (considering 卼陬
		遙弇 and 勛徹繚條...), Commands to actually move a Piece to desired position
		, promotion of piece class,  time counting, win/lose condition, forbidden 
		rules (if any), provides information about current player. Also, interfaces 
		to board settings.. 

		And since we are using Command pattern, we will have the ability to redo/
		undo.

		Then the UI, making use of the GameController, it renders the current board 
		setting, accept Player's selection of pieces in current player's color, then
		accepts legal movements, functions to undo/redo, poll (arguable) the player
		's remaining time, check win/lose criteria after each move (arguable, i 
		prefer listeners or callbacks actually)....and so on

		just my 2 cents.

			unique(A, i, j)
		1.  if ( i = j ) return A[i]
		2.  mid <- ( i + j ) / 2
		3.  if ( A[mid] != A[mid-1] and A[mid] != A[mid+1] ) return A[mid]
		4.  if ( A[mid] = A[mid-1] )
		5.      then if ( (mid - i) % 2 )
		6.          then return unique(A, i, mid-2)
		7.          else return unique(A, i+1, j)
		8.      else if ( (j - mid) % 2 )
		9.          then return unique(A, mid+2, j)
		10.         else return unique(A, i, mid-1)

		A: Check for bug-free and which language do you prefer I use?
		Q: Let's do it in python

		  def unique(A, i, j):

			if i == j: return A[i]

			mid = ㄗi+j)/2

		what is the difference between polymorphism and inheritance? inheritance can

		polymorphism?

		why we need inheritance; before inheritance, we can also reuse the code, why?

		why we need exception? why not if else check?

		why we need generic? before Java5, no generic, all use Object, why generic?

		why we need private/protected...? encapsulation or protection is not a 
		satisfied answer, his option is still protecting the information, a slightly

		we can think of putting cards on a table one at time as an ergodic 
		stochastic process. the time average converges to the expectation when # of 
		cards, say m, is sufficiently large. this means

		b*[1 - (1 - a/b)^m] -> b      as m -> infinite

		About "you randomly toss a point and decide whether or not it falls onto any

		The cards can overlap partially. 

		How to handle this case ?

		楷陓桴: BBS 帤靡諾潔桴 (Mon May 27 12:54:04 2013, 藝陲)

		you know the center and the orientation (assuming card is rectangle) for 
		each card

		to test whether a point falls onto a particular card is equivalent to test 
		whether a 2D point is within a rectangle. 

		one way to do this is to write down the line equations for all sides in the 
		form f(X,Y) = aX + bY + c = 0... and check

		f_1(x, y)*f_2(x, y) <= 0 && f_3(x, y)*f_4(x, y) <= 0

		here f_1 and f_2 denote the line equations of parallel sides and similarly f
		_3, f_4.  f_1(x, y)*f_2(x, y) <= 0 means point (x,y) is between the two 
		parallel sides.

		you can use the above method repetitively for all 52 cards, irrespective of 
		how they overlap. and output true if one of the tests returns true. 


		ps: there may be better ways to test whether a 2D point is within a 
		rectangle.

		You are given a String number containing the digits of a
		phone number (the number of digits, n, can be any positive integer) . To 
		help you memorize
		the number, you want to divide it into groups of contiguous digits. Each 
		group must contain
		exactly 2 or 3 digits. There are three kinds of groups:
		? Excellent: A group that contains only the same digits. For example, 
		000 or 77.
		? Good: A group of 3 digits, 2 of which are the same. For example, 030
		, 229 or 166.
		? Usual: A group in which all the digits are distinct. For example, 
		123 or 90.
		The quality of a group assignment is defined as
		2 ℅ (number of excellent groups) + (number of good groups)
		Divide the number into groups such that the quality is maximized. Design an 
		efficient
		algorithm to return the solution that maximizes the quality.

		Number to String syntax - padding zeros keeping decimal values Options
		12-19-2011 10:40 AM

		Hello team, 
		I am trying get a number, pad it with up to 3 zeros on the left and keep two decimal points of it. 
		ie: if the number is 6.25 i want it to be string "006.25"
		if it is 60.125 i want it to be "060.12" (round the decimal to nearest hundredth)
		 
		I tried using the "Format Into String" with differnet variations of "%03d" and ".2f". but i cannot seem to have a the right combination of both of them in one command. Am I missing something here?
		 
		Using LV2011
		 
		Thanks

		Have you tried %06.2f?

		000.2f does not add the zeros before the number. 

		This is expected behavior, in %06.2f the 6 is the minimum field width, The 0 says to pad with 0 to the left to get the minimum field width and .2f specifies to use 2 digits in the decimal part. In %000.2f the minimum field width is 0 so the result will be your number with 2 decimal digits (no padding to the left is necessary).
		 
		When you use %06.2f with 6.25 you have: 2 decimal digit, the decimal point and number 6, this correspond to a width of 4. So to get to the minimum field width of 6 two zeros are added to the left.

		If you are really interested in the position, never ask similar questions 
		from the interview skills book. The interviewer knows or feels you ask the 
		question for asking. Instead, ask what's your lucky day in XXX company... (
		change from what's your typical working day like).

		Binary semaphores have no ownership attribute and can be released by any 
		thread or interrupt handler regardless of who performed the last take 
		operation. Because of this binary semaphores are often used to synchronize 
		threads with external events implemented as ISRs, for example waiting for a 
		packet from a network or waiting that a button is pressed.

		There is a straight road with 'n' number of milestones. You are given an array with the distance between all the pairs of milestones in some random order. Find the position of milestones.
		Example:
		Consider a road with 4 milestones (a,b,c,d) : a---3Km---b---5Km---c---2Km---d
		Distance between a and b is 3
		Distance between a and c is 8
		Distance between a and d is 10
		Distance between b and c is 5
		Distance between b and d is 7
		Distance between c and d is 2
		All the above values are given in a random order say 7, 10, 5, 2, 8, 3.
		The output must be 3, 5, 2 or 2, 5, 3.

		In "the 100 game,"  two players take turns adding a positive integer <= 10 to a running total.  The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.
		What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use numbers--for example, drawing from the numbers <= 15 without replacement.  Who wins then?

		Write a procedure, "can I win" which determines whether the first player to move can force a win with optimal play.  Players take turns choosing a number from 1 to N without repeating.  The first to make the sum >= the specified total wins.

		Your priority should be to get code working quickly; don't focus on an optimal procedure.

		time ordered , 
		2 travel the startTime, from big to small, and create a listB to store the 
		endTime in order
		  2.1 to the first Race whose startTime is biggest, insert his endTime in 
		the listB, the position is 0, so the score is 0 
		  2.2 to every Racer, binary search his endTime in listB, the position is 
		his score. 

		code:
		  public boolean calScore(ArrayList<Racer> racers){
			//pre-check
			if(racers == null || racers.size() == 0)
			  return false;
			
			HashMap<Integer, Racer> map = new HashMap<Integer, Racer>();
			List<Integer> startTimeList = new ArrayList<Integer>(); 
			for(Racer racer : racers){
			  map.put(racer.getStartTime(), racer);
			  startTimeList.add(racer.getStartTime());
			}

			Collections.sort(startTimeList);
			List<Integer> endTimeList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
			Racer racer;
			for(int i=startTimeList.size() - 1; i>= 0; i--){
			  racer = map.get(startTimeList.get(i));
			  racer.setScore(getPosition(endTimeList, racer.getEndTime()));
			}      
			
			return true;
		  }
		  
		  private int getPosition(List<Integer> endTimes, int x){
			if(endTimes == null || endTimes.size() == 0 ){
			  endTimes.add(0, x);
			  return 0;
			}  
			
			int lower = 0, higher = endTimes.size() - 1, middle;
			
			while(lower <= higher){
			  middle = lower + ((higher - lower) >> 1);
				
			  if(x <= endTimes.get(middle) )
				higher = middle -1;
			  else
				lower = middle + 1;

		1. Sort intervals (s_i, e_i) such that s_0 < s_1 < ... < s_n.  This is O(n*
		log(n)).

		2. Compute c_i, where c_i = number j's where e_j < e_i.  This can be O(n*log
		(n)) by sorting e_i.

		3. Now traverse (s_i, e_i) from 0 to n:

		sorted = [];
		for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		  insert_position = binary_insert e_i into sorted;
		  a_i = c_i - insert_position;
		}

		This step takes O(n*log(n)) as well.

		The result is recorded in a_i.

		Consider an arbitrary string made up of N digits 0-9, e.g., S="01703406777".
		What's an efficient algorithm to figure out if there exists any digit D in 
		the string that has 3 occurrences with equal gaps in the string, i.e., in 
		the example string S, D=0 occurs at 1st (from left), 4th and 7th positions 
		in the string. Also, 7 occurs (with 0 gap) in the last 3 positions. You only
		need to find one set of 3 positions for the digit in the string.

		Given an array of ints, find the most frequent non-empty subarray in it. If there are more than one such sub-arrays return the longest one/s. 
		Note: Two subarrays are equal if they contain identical elements and elements are in the same order.


		For example: if input = {4,5,6,8,3,1,4,5,6,3,1}
		Result: {4,5,6}

		Consider the problem of building a wall out of 2℅1 and 3℅1 bricks (horizontal℅vertical dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the gaps between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers, i.e. never form an internal "running crack". For example, the following 9℅3 wall is not acceptable due to the internal running crack shown as a dotted line: 

		There are eight ways of forming a crack-free 9℅3 wall, written W(9,3) = 8. Write a program to calculate W(32,10). To get you started, here are a few smaller values: 

		W(9, 3) = 8 

		W(18, 5) = 7958

		CMPT 300 - Homework #2

		Due Date: Wednesday, July 10th, 2013

		***Details of submission will be forwarded soon by your TAs***


		SPECIAL NOTE: Homework assignments vary in value
		Problem Description:

		An extended case of the producer-consumer model
		There are 3 generators and each produces a unique kind of material 
		independently. All these materials  are stored in a input buffer with size 
		10 before they are forwarded to the operators. We have 3 operators with 
		same priority who are responsible for  producing the products based on 
		these materials. Each product needs 2 different kinds of materials. Each 
		time an operator needs 2 tools for this purpose. There are totally 3 tools 
		provided for these operators. An operator can only process one product  at 
		one time.  When an operator gets both the materials and tools, he can 
		produce a product within a limited time varied from 0.01 second to 1 
		second. Otherwise, he has to wait until all the necessities are met.  He 
		can grab the materials or tools first, it does not   matter, but he can 
		only get one thing at one time. If an operator decides to make another 
		product before he starts to make the current product , he can put the 
		materials and tools back and re-get the new materials and tools. But he 
		has to put the tools back after he finishes a product because other 
		operators may need these tools. All the products are put into a 
		size-unlimited output queue.  An operator cannot start a new product 
		before he puts the product into the output queue. Some restrictions may 
		apply to these products: 1) No same products can be next to each other in 
		this queue.  We say that two products are same if they are made from the 
		same kinds of materials. 2) The difference of the number of any two kinds 
		of products produced should be less than 10, for example, we can have 10 
		of product A and 15 of product B, but it is not allowed if we have 10 of 
		A and 21 of B because the difference is 11 which is larger than 10. 
		 

		Problem Requirements:

		You should write a program to simulate this model using  C/C++ on the 
		platform of WinNT/SunOS UNIX with the multi-thread techniques. Your 
		program should not be stalled in a dead cycle at any time. During the 
		execution of your program, you should provide these information 
		dynamically:
		1)  For each material, how many are generated? 
		2)  The status of the input buffer 
		3)  For each kind of product, how may are produced? 
		4)  The status of the output queue. 
		5)  How many times the deadlock happens? 
		  
		Also provide these functions

		1)  Pause and resume the program at any time. 
		2)  Make the number of operators and tools adjustable. 
		Please feel free to provide additional information and functions that you 
		consider useful.

		What to  hand in:

		1)  A hard and soft copy of your source code. 
		2)  A soft copy of your executable files. Please make sure all the 
		files are virus free. I will not check your files if any virus is 
		detected, which  means you will lose the points. 
		3)  A hard copy of a report documenting the internal design of your 
		program.

		Marking Strategy:

				The most important thing is to make sure your program works 
		correctly.  Do not worry about your programming style or efficiency. But 
		it does matter if you provide a smarter internal design(approach)  and 
		user-friendly interface.

		Determine if Two Rotated Rectangles Overlap Each Other

		Published by liuyruc on July 14, 2013 | Leave a response
		The question is how to determine if two rectangles overlap each other. To simplify the question, we say the rectangles are on a 2 dimensional plane. The rectangles can be rotated.


		The first problem is How to represent a rectangle. The easiest way is to use four points. The code is shown as below

		typedef struct point {
			int x;
			int y;
		} Point;
		 
		typedef struct rectangle {
			Point p[4];
		} Rectangle;
		Actually, using three points is sufficient, since the last one can be calculate by the first three. This solution use 8 integers to present a rectangle. Another solution is to use angle. First of all, we need the angle between the first (counter-clockwise) side and x-axis. We also need a start point, and the length of each side. Then the struct can be,


		typedef struct point {
			int x;
			int y;
		} Point;
		 
		typedef struct rectangle {
			Point start;
			int angle;
			int side0, side1;
		} Rectangle;
		The solution takes 6 integers, which is a little bit better.

		Now, we come the second question, how to determine two rectangles are intersected. If the Edges are parallel to the coordinate axes, it is not that complicated, check this article. While, if the given rectangles are rotated by any angle, my solution is to check the corners of each rectangle. If one of them is inside of another rectangle, these two rectangles overlap. Otherwise, they are not.

		The problem is how to determine if a point is in a rectangle. The idea is to use orientation of a three point triplet. Suppose that the rectangle, r, has four points, {a, b, c, d}. The given point is p. We can observe that,

		If p is inside of r, (a, b, p), (b, c, p), (c, d, p) and (d, a, p) will take the same orientations.
		Otherwise, at least one of them have a different orientation.
		To simplify the implementation, we use four points to represent a rectangle. The implementation is shown as below,

		// Find the orientation of ordered triplet(p, q, r).
		// 0 - colinear
		// 1 - clockwise
		// 2 - counterclockwise
		int orientation(Point *p, Point *q, Point *r)
		{
			int val = (q->y - p->y) * (r->x - q->x) - 
					  (q->x - p->x) * (r->y - q->y);
		 
			if (0 == val)
				return 0;
			return val > 0 ? 1: 2;
		}
		 
		// Exam if a point is in a rectangle
		// 0 - Out
		// 1 - In
		int is_point_in_rectangle(Point *p, Rectangle *rec) 
		{
			Point *rp = rec->p;
			// orientaion
			int o = orientation(rp + 0, rp + 1, p);
		 
			if (o == 0)
				return 1;
		 
			return  o == orientation(rp + 1, rp + 2, p) &&
					o == orientation(rp + 2, rp + 3, p) &&
					o == orientation(rp + 3, rp + 0, p); 
		}
		 
		// Exam if two rectangles are intersected
		// 0 - Not intersected
		// 1 - Intersected
		int is_intersected(Rectangle *rec0, Rectangle *rec1)
		{
			Point *p0 = rec0->p;
			Point *p1 = rec1->p;
			int i;
		 
			// check whether a point of rec0 is in rec1
			// And whether a point of rec1 is in rec0 
			for (i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
				if (is_point_in_rectangle(p0 + i, rec1))
					return 1;
		 
				if (is_point_in_rectangle(p1 + i, rec0))
					return 1;
			}
		 
			return 0;
		}
		The code below includes this implementation and test cases. There is also a function to generate random rectangles.

		
		#include <stdlib.h>
		#include <time.h>
		#include <stdio.h>

		typedef struct rectangle {
			Point p[4];
		} Rectangle;
		 
		// Find the orientation of ordered triplet(p, q, r).
		// 0 - colinear
		// 1 - clockwise
		// 2 - counterclockwise
		int orientation(Point *p, Point *q, Point *r)
		{
			int val = (q->y - p->y) * (r->x - q->x) - 
					  (q->x - p->x) * (r->y - q->y);
		 
			if (0 == val)
				return 0;
			return val > 0 ? 1: 2;
		}
		 
		// Generate a random rectangle
		void generate_random_rectangle(Rectangle *rec)
		{
			if (0 == rec)
				return;
		 
			// center of the rectangle

			// first point of the rectangle
			do {

			} while((rec->p)[0].x == c.x && (rec->p)[0].y == c.y);
			// then the third point
			(rec->p)[2].x = c.x * 2 - (rec->p)[0].x;
			(rec->p)[2].y = c.y * 2 - (rec->p)[0].y;
		 
			// generate the second point
			// 1st point, center, 2 point shouldn't on a line
			do {
				(rec->p)[1].x = rand() % LIMIT;
				(rec->p)[1].y = rand() % LIMIT;
			} while (orientation(rec->p + 0, &c, rec->p + 1) == 0);

		A prefix of a string S is any leading contiguous part of S. A suffix of the string S is any trailing contiguous part of S. For example, "c" and "cod" are prefixes, and "ty" and "ity" are suffixes of the string "codility". For simplicity, we require prefixes and suffixes to be non-empty and shorter than the whole string S. 
		A border of a string S is any string that is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, "cut" is a border of a string "cutletcut", and a string "barbararhubarb" has two borders: "b" and "barb". 
		We are looking for such borders of S that have at least three non-overlapping occurrences; that is, for some string that occurs as a prefix, as a suffix and elsewhere in between. For example, for S = "barbararhubarb", the only such string is "b". 
		In this problem we consider only strings that consist of lower-case English letters (a?z). 
		Write a function:


		class Solution { public int solution(String S); }
		that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns the length of its longest border that has at least three non-overlapping occurrences in the given string. If there is no such border in S, the function should return 0. 
		For example, given a string S as follows: 
		if S = "barbararhubarb" the function should return 1, as explained above; 
		if S = "ababab" the function should return 2, as "ab" and "abab" are both borders of S, but only "ab" has three non-overlapping occurrences; 
		if S = "baaab" the function should return 0, as its only border "b" occurs only twice. 
		Assume that: 
		N is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000]; 
		string S consists only of lower-case letters (a?z). 
		Complexity: 
		expected worst-case time complexity is O(N); 
		expected worst-case space complexity is O(N) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

		1. Generate Fibonacci number without iteration and recursion



		2. Given two functions
		vector<lock_id> has_ID(thread_id) // give a thread_id, return all locks it 
		currently has
		vector<lock_id> want_ID(thread_id) // give a thread_id, return all locks it 
		is waiting

		and a set of thread_ids, how do you determine if there is a deadlock in the 
		system



		3. Complexity of solving a system of linear equations. How many floating 
		point operations per clock cycle is a modern CPU (say intel core-i series) 
		capable of? Use this to give an order of magnitude estimate of the running 
		time of solving a system of linear equations with given size (say n = 1000).



		4. Why is entropy defined as E_p[log(p)]. The interviewer drew sketches of 
		several distributions and asked which one has the largest entropy (don't 
		need to compute explicitly).


		5. Given large samples (x_i, y_i) of a pair r.v. (X, Y), can you come up 
		with some quick and dirty way to determine if X and Y are independent 
		without resorting to estimate joint/marginal pdf.


		6. Implement Newton's method


		7. Given pairs of related IDs, e.g. (ID_1, ID_2), (ID_2, ID_6), (ID_4, ID_3)
		, implement a function which returns all related IDs for any input ID. Note 
		that the relationship is transitive. 
		E.g.
		input: ID_6
		output: ID_1, ID_2

		input ID_4
		output: ID_3



		8. How to estimate probability density function given random samples. If you
		answer histogram, then how to determine the number of bins. And the pdf 
		should be smooth, what should you do after computing the histogram?


		9. Find median for an infinite stream of numbers.  You can do it 
		approximately, but state your assumption.


		10. How to prove that geometric mean is no greater than arithmetic mean?


		11. Design a way to generate a fair coin when you can toss a biased coin, 
		with prob(H) = p, for n (n is large, say n > 1000) times. How many fair coin
		toss can you make out of it?

		楷陓桴: BBS 帤靡諾潔桴 (Thu Feb 28 14:27:11 2013, 藝陲)

		Detecting Cycles  

		Description:

		Given a sequence, write a program to detect cycles within it.
		Input sample:

		A file containing a sequence of numbers (space delimited). The file can have
		multiple such lines. e.g

		2 0 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 3 1
		Ensure to account for numbers that have more than one digit eg. 12. If there
		is no sequence, ignore that line.
		Output sample:

		Print to stdout the first sequence you find in each line. Ensure that there 
		are no trailing empty spaces on each line you print. e.g.

		6 3 1

		Any good idea?
		Thanks a lot.

		every time you consider a new integer, fill in one column of DPㄛthe 
		difference between this problem and the balanced partition problem is that 
		DP[s][i] is now a vector contains all indices leading to subset sum being 
		equal to s﹝

		when you back track starting at DP[A/3][n-1], you can easily get all 
		feasible subsets. Then it's not difficult to determine whether three of them
		form the original array.

		As such, this may lead to exponential running time when all integers are 
		equal. To guarantee polynomial time, for each feasible subset, you repeat 
		the above procedure for the remaining integers that are not in this set.

		have a flat xml string: 
		<Node1>n1<Node2>n2<Node3>n3</Node3><Node4>n4</Node4></Node2></Node1>

		How to convert it into a tree structure below. Suppose you have a XML parser
		can tell you getNextTag(); isTagStartingNode(); isTagEndNode(); isTagString()

				   n1
				  / 
				 n2
				/  \
			   n3   n4

		Any idea?
		
// <Node1>n1<Node2>n2<Node3>n3</Node3><Node4>n4</Node4></Node2></Node1>
				   n1
				  / 
				 n2
				/  \
			   n3   n4


		string getNextTag(); 
		bool isTagStartingNode(string tag); 
		bool isTagEndNode(string tag); 
		bool isTagString(string tag)

		struct TreeNode {
			string value;
			TreeNode *left;
			TreeNode *right;
			
			TreeNode(string v) : value(v), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
		};

		TreeNode *parse(string startTag) {
			// no more nodes left
			if(str.size() == 0) 
				return NULL;
			if(startTag.size() == 0) {
				string str = getNextTag();
				// invalid input?
				if(!isTagStartingNode(str))
					return NULL;
				return parse(str);
			} else if(isTagString(str)) {
				TreeNode *root = new TreeNode(str);
				string nextStr = getNextTag();
				if(isTagStartingNode(nextStr)) {
					root->left = parse(nextStr);
					nextStr = getNextTag();
					if(isTagEndNode(nextStr)) {
						root->right = NULL;
						return root;
					} else {

		You are given a paragraph , which contain n number of words, you are given m
		threads. What you need to do is , each thread should print one word and 
		give the control to next thread, this way each thread will keep on printing 
		one word , in case last thread come, it should invoke the first thread. 
		Printing will repeat until all the words are printed in paragraph. Finally 
		all threads should exit gracefully. What kind of synchronization will use?

		I have no idea how to solve this question. Any guru helps me? Thanks.

		At a higher level, 3 major principles guiding all of your office actions:

		1) empathy - put yourself in your peers, your underlings, your boss, your 
		customer's shoes - what are their motives, interests, perspectives, and how 
		do you take that into consideration when you want to achieve what you want? 
		the more you can think like them and speak/write in a language that resonate
		with them, the more likely you will achieve your goal.

		2) expectation management: satisfaction = result - expectation.  you can 
		achieve your result, but if the expectation of your boss was very high, then
		in his mind you might still be seen as a failure.  at the same time, i do 
		not promote lowballing either - no one likes to give work to a CYA type who'
		s always pessimistic and looking for excuses ahead of time.  this is a 
		delicate balance and it's an art from that's at the core of every consulting
		company.

		3) visibility management - you need visibility in order to move ahead.  sure
		every now and then you get a great boss who appreciates everything about 
		you and actively tries to move you ahead, but absence of that, you need to 
		create visibility / brand name inside and outside of your team.  Note this 
		is NOT about blasting everyone on everything you have done - there are much 
		more subtle and tactful ways to do that (a general rule of thumb is always 
		put your accomplishment in the context of the specific goal that the 
		organization is trying to achieve - that way, you are seen as a team player 
		as oppose to someone bragging.)  And executive meetings are never a place to
		doze off - a few well timed and insightful comments will go a long way to 
		make an impression on your skip bosses, who, along w/ your boss, will 
		determine your future.


		More specifically, it's all about being professional:
		a) hard work and intelligence is a given - i.e., it's assumed you have both,
		or put it another way, don't think these two by itself is going to be your 
		competitive advantage

		a) be punctual - be at work and meeting on time

		b) always be prepared at meetings - w/ notebook and/or computer taking notes

		c) be reliable - if you say you will do something by tomorrow, do it

		d) at the same time, if you know you can not do something, better to 
		communicate that now than later

		e) be courteous and respectful - even if someone doesn't know what 
		he/shes' doing - trying to help out as oppose to be condescending - there 
		will be times you will be at the other end

		f) be proactive - if you see something that needs to be done, take 
		initiative

		g) be a good teammate - will others like to work with you?

		h) don't be drama queen - this is especially true for women - getting 
		emotional (worse yet, crying) might get you sympathy points, but you have 
		lost all professional respect going forward.  there's one school of thought 
		that if you mother is in the hospital, you dog died, and you didn't have a 
		place to sleep over the weekend; if someone asks you how you are doing on 
		monday, you respond "everything is great!"  now i don't subscribe to that 
		completely but you get what i am saying here.

		i) there's more... but when in doubt, refer to the principles above

		How remove duplicated elements on a single-linked list with O(n) time and O(1) space ?

		The elements can be any characters, numbers and they are not sorted.

		For example, given 8 --> 6 --> 7 --> 6 --> 5

		return 8 --> 6 --> 7 --> 5

		O(1) space seems to be tough ?

		Any help would be appreciated !

		Thanks

		Find the length of the longest non-decreasing sequence through adjacent, non
		-repeating cells (including diagonals) in a rectangular grid of numbers in a
		language of your choice. The solution should handle grids of arbitrary 
		width and height.
		For example, in the following grid, one legal path (though not the longest) 
		that could be traced is 0->3->7->9 and its length would be 4.
		8 2 4
		0 7 1
		3 7 9
		The path can only connect adjacent locations (you could not connect 8 -> 9).
		The longest possible sequence for this example would be of length 6 by 
		tracing the path 0->2->4->7->7->9 or 1->2->4->7->7->8.
		Write a method, in a language of your choice, that takes a rectangular grid 
		of numbers as input, and returns the length of the longest such sequence as 
		output.

		C/C++ Interview Questions

		how do you find out if a linked-list has an end? (i.e. the list is not a 
		cycle)

		You can find out by using 2 pointers. One of them goes 2 nodes each time. 
		The second one goes at 1 nodes each time. If there is a cycle, the one that 
		goes 2 nodes each time will eventually meet the one that goes slower. If 
		that is the case, then you will know the linked-list is a cycle.

		What is the difference between realloc() and free()?

		The free subroutine frees a block of memory previously allocated by the 
		malloc subroutine. Undefined results occur if the Pointer parameter is not a
		valid pointer. If the Pointer parameter is a null value, no action will 
		occur. The realloc subroutine changes the size of the block of memory 
		pointed to by the Pointer parameter to the number of bytes specified by the 
		Size parameter and returns a new pointer to the block. The pointer specified
		by the Pointer parameter must have been created with the malloc, calloc, or
		realloc subroutines and not been deallocated with the free or realloc 
		subroutines. Undefined results occur if the Pointer parameter is not a valid
		pointer.

		What is function overloading and operator overloading?

		Function overloading: C++ enables several functions of the same name to be 
		defined, as long as these functions have different sets of parameters (at 
		least as far as their types are concerned). This capability is called 
		function overloading. When an overloaded function is called, the C++ 
		compiler selects the proper function by examining the number, types and 
		order of the arguments in the call. Function overloading is commonly used to
		create several functions of the same name that perform similar tasks but on
		different data types.

		Operator overloading allows existing C++ operators to be redefined so that 
		they work on objects of user-defined classes. Overloaded operators are 
		syntactic sugar for equivalent function calls. They form a pleasant facade 
		that doesn＊t add anything fundamental to the language (but they can improve
		understandability and reduce maintenance costs).

		What is the difference between declaration and definition?

		The declaration tells the compiler that at some later point we plan to 
		present the definition of this declaration.
		E.g.: void stars () //function declaration
		The definition contains the actual implementation.
		E.g.: void stars () // declarator
		{
		for(int j=10; j > =0; j每) //function body
		cout << *;
		cout <<>

		What are the advantages of inheritance?

		It permits code reusability. Reusability saves time in program development. 
		It encourages the reuse of proven and debugged high-quality software, thus 
		reducing problem after a system becomes functional.

		How do you write a function that can reverse a linked-list?

		void reverselist(void)
		{
		if(head==0)
		return;
		if(head->next==0)
		return;
		if(head->next==tail)
		{
		head->next = 0;
		tail->next = head;
		}
		else
		{
		node* pre = head;
		node* cur = head->next;
		node* curnext = cur->next;
		head->next = 0;
		cur-> next = head;

		for(; curnext!=0; )
		{
		cur->next = pre;
		pre = cur;
		cur = curnext;
		curnext = curnext->next;
		}
		curnext->next = cur;
		}
		}

		What do you mean by inline function?

		The idea behind inline functions is to insert the code of a called function 
		at the point where the function is called. If done carefully, this can 
		improve the application＊s performance in exchange for increased compile 
		time and possibly (but not always) an increase in the size of the generated 
		binary executables.

		Write a program that ask for user input from 5 to 9 then calculate the 
		average

		#include ※iostream.h§
		int main() {
		int MAX = 4;
		int total = 0;
		int average;
		int numb;
		for (int i=0; icout << ※Please enter your input between 5 and 9: ※;
		cin >> numb;
		while ( numb<5>9) {
		cout << ※Invalid input, please re-enter: ※;
		cin >> numb;
		}
		total = total + numb;
		}
		average = total/MAX;
		cout << ※The average number is: § <<>return 0;
		}

		What is public, protected, private?

			* Public, protected and private are three access specifiers in C++.
			* Public data members and member functions are accessible outside the 
		class.
			* Protected data members and member functions are only available to 
		derived classes.
			* Private data members and member functions can＊t be accessed outside 
		the class. However there is an exception can be using friend classes.

		Write a function that swaps the values of two integers, using int* as the 
		argument type.
		void swap(int* a, int*b) {
		int t;
		t = *a;
		*a = *b;
		*b = t;
		}

		Tell how to check whether a linked list is circular.

		Create two pointers, each set to the start of the list. Update each as 
		follows:
		while (pointer1) {
		pointer1 = pointer1->next;
		pointer2 = pointer2->next; if (pointer2) pointer2=pointer2->next;
		if (pointer1 == pointer2) {
		print (\§circular\n\§);
		}
		}

		OK, why does this work?
		If a list is circular, at some point pointer2 will wrap around and be either
		at the item just before pointer1, or the item before that. Either way, it＊
		s either 1 or 2 jumps until they meet.

		What is polymorphism?

		Polymorphism is the idea that a base class can be inherited by several 
		classes. A base class pointer can point to its child class and a base class 
		array can store different child class objects.

		What is virtual constructors/destructors?

		Answer1
		Virtual destructors:
		If an object (with a non-virtual destructor) is destroyed explicitly by 
		applying the delete operator to a base-class pointer to the object, the base
		-class destructor function (matching the pointer type) is called on the 
		object.
		There is a simple solution to this problem declare a virtual base-class 
		destructor.
		This makes all derived-class destructors virtual even though they don＊t 
		have the same name as the base-class destructor. Now, if the object in the 
		hierarchy is destroyed explicitly by applying the delete operator to a base-
		class pointer to a derived-class object, the destructor for the appropriate 
		class is called. Virtual constructor: Constructors cannot be virtual. 
		Declaring a constructor as a virtual function is a syntax error.

		Answer2
		Virtual destructors: If an object (with a non-virtual destructor) is 
		destroyed explicitly by applying the delete operator to a base-class pointer
		to the object, the base-class destructor function (matching the pointer 
		type) is called on the object.
		There is a simple solution to this problem 每 declare a virtual base-class 
		destructor. This makes all derived-class destructors virtual even though 
		they don＊t have the same name as the base-class destructor. Now, if the 
		object in the hierarchy is destroyed explicitly by applying the delete 
		operator to a base-class pointer to a derived-class object, the destructor 
		for the appropriate class is called.

		Virtual constructor: Constructors cannot be virtual. Declaring a constructor
		as a virtual function is a syntax error.

		Does c++ support multilevel and multiple inheritance?
		Yes.

		What are the advantages of inheritance?
		? It permits code reusability.
		? Reusability saves time in program development.
		? It encourages the reuse of proven and debugged high-quality software
		, thus reducing problem after a system becomes functional.
		What is the difference between declaration and definition?
		The declaration tells the compiler that at some later point we plan to 
		present the definition of this declaration.
		E.g.: void stars () //function declaration
		The definition contains the actual implementation.
		E.g.: void stars () // declarator
		{
		for(int j=10; j>=0; j每) //function body
		cout<<§*§;
		cout<
		What is the difference between an ARRAY and a LIST?

		Answer1
		Array is collection of homogeneous elements.
		List is collection of heterogeneous elements.

		For Array memory allocated is static and continuous.
		For List memory allocated is dynamic and Random.

		Array: User need not have to keep in track of next memory allocation.
		List: User has to keep in Track of next location where memory is allocated.

		Answer2
		Array uses direct access of stored members, list uses sequencial access for 
		members.

		//With Array you have direct access to memory position 5
		Object x = a[5]; // x takes directly a reference to 5th element of array

		//With the list you have to cross all previous nodes in order to get the 5th
		node:
		list mylist;
		list::iterator it;

		for( it = list.begin() ; it != list.end() ; it++ )
		{
		if( i==5)
		{
		x = *it;
		break;
		}
		i++;
		}

		What is a template?

		Templates allow to create generic functions that admit any data type as 
		parameters and return value without having to overload the function with all
		the possible data types. Until certain point they fulfill the functionality
		of a macro. Its prototype is any of the two following ones:

		template function_declaration; template function_declaration;

		The only difference between both prototypes is the use of keyword class or 
		typename, its use is indistinct since both expressions have exactly the same
		meaning and behave exactly the same way.

		You have two pairs: new() and delete() and another pair : alloc() and free()
		. Explain differences between eg. new() and malloc()

		Answer1
		1.) ※new and delete§ are preprocessors while ※malloc() and free()§ are 
		functions. [we dont use brackets will calling new or delete].
		2.) no need of allocate the memory while using ※new§ but in ※malloc()§ 
		we have to use ※sizeof()§.
		3.) ※new§ will initlize the new memory to 0 but ※malloc()§ gives random 
		value in the new alloted memory location [better to use calloc()]

		Answer2
		new() allocates continous space for the object instace
		malloc() allocates distributed space.
		new() is castless, meaning that allocates memory for this specific type,
		malloc(), calloc() allocate space for void * that is cated to the specific 
		class type pointer.

		What is the difference between class and structure?

		Structure: Initially (in C) a structure was used to bundle different type of
		data types together to perform a particular functionality. But C++ extended
		the structure to contain functions also. The major difference is that all 
		declarations inside a structure are by default public.
		Class: Class is a successor of Structure. By default all the members inside 
		the class are private.

		What is RTTI?

		Runtime type identification (RTTI) lets you find the dynamic type of an 
		object when you have only a pointer or a reference to the base type. RTTI is
		the official way in standard C++ to discover the type of an object and to 
		convert the type of a pointer or reference (that is, dynamic typing). The 
		need came from practical experience with C++. RTTI replaces many homegrown 
		versions with a solid, consistent approach.

		What is encapsulation?

		Packaging an object＊s variables within its methods is called encapsulation.

		Explain term POLIMORPHISM and give an example using eg. SHAPE object: If I 
		have a base class SHAPE, how would I define DRAW methods for two objects 
		CIRCLE and SQUARE

		Answer1
		POLYMORPHISM : A phenomenon which enables an object to react differently to 
		the same function call.
		in C++ it is attained by using a keyword virtual

		Example
		public class SHAPE
		{
		public virtual void SHAPE::DRAW()=0;
		}
		Note here the function DRAW() is pure virtual which means the sub classes 
		must implement the DRAW() method and SHAPE cannot be instatiated

		public class CIRCLE::public SHAPE
		{
		public void CIRCLE::DRAW()
		{
		// TODO drawing circle
		}
		}
		public class SQUARE::public SHAPE
		{
		public void SQUARE::DRAW()
		{
		// TODO drawing square
		}
		}
		now from the user class the calls would be like
		globally
		SHAPE *newShape;

		When user action is to draw
		public void MENU::OnClickDrawCircle(){
		newShape = new CIRCLE();
		}

		public void MENU::OnClickDrawCircle(){
		newShape = new SQUARE();
		}

		the when user actually draws
		public void CANVAS::OnMouseOperations(){
		newShape->DRAW();
		}

		Answer2
		class SHAPE{
		public virtual Draw() = 0; //abstract class with a pure virtual method
		};

		class CIRCLE{
		public int r;
		public virtual Draw() { this->drawCircle(0,0,r); }
		};

		class SQURE
		public int a;
		public virtual Draw() { this->drawRectangular(0,0,a,a); }
		};

		Each object is driven down from SHAPE implementing Draw() function in its 
		own way.

		What is an object?

		Object is a software bundle of variables and related methods. Objects have 
		state and behavior.

		How can you tell what shell you are running on UNIX system?

		You can do the Echo $RANDOM. It will return a undefined variable if you are 
		from the C-Shell, just a return prompt if you are from the Bourne shell, and
		a 5 digit random numbers if you are from the Korn shell. You could also do 
		a ps -l and look for the shell with the highest PID.

		Describe PRIVATE, PROTECTED and PUBLIC 每 the differences and give examples.

		class Point2D{
		int x; int y;
		public int color;
		protected bool pinned;
		public Point2D() : x(0) , y(0) {} //default (no argument) constructor
		};
		Point2D MyPoint;
		You cannot directly access private data members when they are declared (
		implicitly) private:
		MyPoint.x = 5; // Compiler will issue a compile ERROR
		//Nor yoy can see them:
		int x_dim = MyPoint.x; // Compiler will issue a compile ERROR
		On the other hand, you can assign and read the public data members:
		MyPoint.color = 255; // no problem
		int col = MyPoint.color; // no problem
		With protected data members you can read them but not write them: MyPoint.
		pinned = true; // Compiler will issue a compile ERROR
		bool isPinned = MyPoint.pinned; // no problem

		What is namespace?

		Namespaces allow us to group a set of global classes, objects and/or 
		functions under a name. To say it somehow, they serve to split the global 
		scope in sub-scopes known as namespaces.
		The form to use namespaces is:
		namespace identifier { namespace-body }
		Where identifier is any valid identifier and namespace-body is the set of 
		classes, objects and functions that are included within the namespace. For 
		example:
		namespace general { int a, b; } In this case, a and b are normal variables 
		integrated within the general namespace. In order to access to these 
		variables from outside the namespace we have to use the scope operator ::. 
		For example, to access the previous variables we would have to put:
		general::a general::b
		The functionality of namespaces is specially useful in case that there is a 
		possibility that a global object or function can have the same name than 
		another one, causing a redefinition error.

		What do you mean by inheritance?

		Inheritance is the process of creating new classes, called derived classes, 
		from existing classes or base classes. The derived class inherits all the 
		capabilities of the base class, but can add embellishments and refinements 
		of its own.

		What is a COPY CONSTRUCTOR and when is it called?

		A copy constructor is a method that accepts an object of the same class and 
		copies it＊s data members to the object on the left part of assignement:
		class Point2D{
		int x; int y;
		public int color;
		protected bool pinned;
		public Point2D() : x(0) , y(0) {} //default (no argument) constructor
		public Point2D( const Point2D & ) ;
		};
		Point2D::Point2D( const Point2D & p )
		{
		this->x = p.x;
		this->y = p.y;
		this->color = p.color;
		this->pinned = p.pinned;
		}
		main(){
		Point2D MyPoint;
		MyPoint.color = 345;
		Point2D AnotherPoint = Point2D( MyPoint ); // now AnotherPoint has color = 
		345

		What is Boyce Codd Normal form?

		A relation schema R is in BCNF with respect to a set F of functional 
		dependencies if for all functional dependencies in F+ of the form a-> , 
		where a and b is a subset of R, at least one of the following holds:
		* a- > b is a trivial functional dependency (b is a subset of a)
		* a is a superkey for schema R

		What is virtual class and friend class?

		Friend classes are used when two or more classes are designed to work 
		together and need access to each other＊s implementation in ways that the 
		rest of the world shouldn＊t be allowed to have. In other words, they help 
		keep private things private. For instance, it may be desirable for class 
		DatabaseCursor to have more privilege to the internals of class Database 
		than main() has.

		What is the word you will use when defining a function in base class to 
		allow this function to be a polimorphic function?

		virtual

		What do you mean by binding of data and functions?

		Encapsulation.

		What are 2 ways of exporting a function from a DLL?

		1.Taking a reference to the function from the DLL instance.
		2. Using the DLL ＊s Type Library.

		What is the difference between an object and a class?

		Classes and objects are separate but related concepts. Every object belongs 
		to a class and every class contains one or more related objects.
		- A Class is static. All of the attributes of a class are fixed before, 
		during, and after the execution of a program. The attributes of a class don
		＊t change.
		- The class to which an object belongs is also (usually) static. If a 
		particular object belongs to a certain class at the time that it is created 
		then it almost certainly will still belong to that class right up until the 
		time that it is destroyed.
		- An Object on the other hand has a limited lifespan. Objects are created 
		and eventually destroyed. Also during that lifetime, the attributes of the 
		object may undergo significant change.

		Suppose that data is an array of 1000 integers. Write a single function call
		that will sort the 100 elements data [222] through data [321].

		quicksort ((data + 222), 100);

		What is a class?

		Class is a user-defined data type in C++. It can be created to solve a 
		particular kind of problem. After creation the user need not know the 
		specifics of the working of a class.

		What is friend function?

		As the name suggests, the function acts as a friend to a class. As a friend 
		of a class, it can access its private and protected members. A friend 
		function is not a member of the class. But it must be listed in the class 
		definition.

		Which recursive sorting technique always makes recursive calls to sort 
		subarrays that are about half size of the original array?

		Mergesort always makes recursive calls to sort subarrays that are about half
		size of the original array, resulting in O(n log n) time.

		What is abstraction?

		Abstraction is of the process of hiding unwanted details from the user.

		What are virtual functions?

		A virtual function allows derived classes to replace the implementation 
		provided by the base class. The compiler makes sure the replacement is 
		always called whenever the object in question is actually of the derived 
		class, even if the object is accessed by a base pointer rather than a 
		derived pointer. This allows algorithms in the base class to be replaced in 
		the derived class, even if users don＊t know about the derived class.

		What is the difference between an external iterator and an internal iterator
		? Describe an advantage of an external iterator.

		An internal iterator is implemented with member functions of the class that 
		has items to step through. .An external iterator is implemented as a 
		separate class that can be ※attach§ to the object that has items to step 
		through. .An external iterator has the advantage that many difference 
		iterators can be active simultaneously on the same object.

		What is a scope resolution operator?

		A scope resolution operator (::), can be used to define the member functions
		of a class outside the class.

		What do you mean by pure virtual functions?

		A pure virtual member function is a member function that the base class 
		forces derived classes to provide. Normally these member functions have no 
		implementation. Pure virtual functions are equated to zero.

		class Shape { public: virtual void draw() = 0; };

		What is polymorphism? Explain with an example?

		※Poly§ means ※many§ and ※morph§ means ※form§. Polymorphism is the 
		ability of an object (or reference) to assume (be replaced by) or become 
		many different forms of object.
		Example: function overloading, function overriding, virtual functions. 
		Another example can be a plus ＆+＊ sign, used for adding two integers or 
		for using it to concatenate two strings.

		How can you quickly find the number of elements stored in a a) static array 
		b) dynamic array ?
		Why is it difficult to store linked list in an array?
		How can you find the nodes with repetetive data in a linked list?

		Write a prog to accept a given string in any order and flash error if any of
		the character is different. For example : If abc is the input then abc, bca
		, cba, cab bac are acceptable but aac or bcd are unacceptable.
		Write out a function that prints out all the permutations of a string. For 
		example, abc would give you abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba. You can assume 
		that all the characters will be unique.

		What＊s the output of the following program? Why?

		#include
		main()
		{
		typedef union
		{
		int a;
		char b[10];
		float c;
		}
		Union;
		Union x,y = {100};
		x.a = 50;
		strcpy(x.b,\§hello\§);
		x.c = 21.50;
		printf(\§Union x : %d %s %f \n\§,x.a,x.b,x.c );
		printf(\§Union y :%d %s%f \n\§,y.a,y.b,y.c);
		}
		Given inputs X, Y, Z and operations | and & (meaning bitwise OR and AND, 
		respectively)
		What is output equal to in

		output = (X & Y) | (X & Z) | (Y & Z)

		Why are arrays usually processed with for loop?

		The real power of arrays comes from their facility of using an index 
		variable to traverse the array, accessing each element with the same 
		expression a[i]. All the is needed to make this work is a iterated statement
		in which the variable i serves as a counter, incrementing from 0 to a.
		length -1. That is exactly what a loop does.

		What is an HTML tag?

		An HTML tag is a syntactical construct in the HTML language that abbreviates
		specific instructions to be executed when the HTML script is loaded into a 
		Web browser. It is like a method in Java, a function in C++, a procedure in 
		Pascal, or a subroutine in FORTRAN.

		What problems might the following macro bring to the application?

		#define sq(x) x*x

		Anything wrong with this code?
		T *p = new T[10];
		delete p;

		Everything is correct, Only the first element of the array will be deleted§
		, The entire array will be deleted, but only the first element destructor 
		will be called.

		Anything wrong with this code?
		T *p = 0;
		delete p;

		Yes, It＊s an attempt to delete a null pointer.

		How do you decide which integer type to use?

		It depends on our requirement. When we are required an integer to be stored 
		in 1 byte (means less than or equal to 255) we use short int, for 2 bytes we
		use int, for 8 bytes we use long int.
		A char is for 1-byte integers, a short is for 2-byte integers, an int is 
		generally a 2-byte or 4-byte integer (though not necessarily), a long is a 4
		-byte integer, and a long long is a 8-byte integer.

		What＊s the best way to declare and define global variables?

		The best way to declare global variables is to declare them after including 
		all the files so that it can be used in all the functions.

		What does extern mean in a function declaration?

		Using extern in a function declaration we can make a function such that it 
		can used outside the file in which it is defined.
		An extern variable, function definition, or declaration also makes the 
		described variable or function usable by the succeeding part of the current 
		source file. This declaration does not replace the definition. The 
		declaration is used to describe the variable that is externally defined.
		If a declaration for an identifier already exists at file scope, any extern 
		declaration of the same identifier found within a block refers to that same 
		object. If no other declaration for the identifier exists at file scope, the
		identifier has external linkage.

		What can I safely assume about the initial values of variables which are not
		explicitly initialized?

		It depends on complier which may assign any garbage value to a variable if 
		it is not initialized.

		What is the difference between char a[] = ※string§; and char *p = ※string
		§;?

		In the first case 6 bytes are allocated to the variable a which is fixed, 
		where as in the second case if *p is assigned to some other value the 
		allocate memory can change.

		What＊s the auto keyword good for?

		Answer1
		Not much. It declares an object with automatic storage duration. Which means
		the object will be destroyed at the end of the objects scope. All variables
		in functions that are not declared as static and not dynamically allocated 
		have automatic storage duration by default.
		For example
		int main()
		{
		int a; //this is the same as writing ※auto int a;§
		}

		Answer2
		Local variables occur within a scope; they are ※local§ to a function. They
		are often called automatic variables because they automatically come into 
		being when the scope is entered and automatically go away when the scope 
		closes. The keyword auto makes this explicit, but local variables default to
		auto auto auto auto so it is never necessary to declare something as an 
		auto auto auto auto.

		What is the difference between char a[] = ※string§; and char *p = ※string
		§; ?

		Answer1
		a[] = ※string§;
		char *p = ※string§;

		The difference is this:
		p is pointing to a constant string, you can never safely say
		p[3]=＊x＊;
		however you can always say a[3]=＊x＊;
		char a[]=§string§; 每 character array initialization.
		char *p=§string§ ; 每 non-const pointer to a const-string.( this is 
		permitted only in the case of char pointer in C++ to preserve backward 
		compatibility with C.)

		Answer2
		a[] = ※string§;
		char *p = ※string§;
		a[] will have 7 bytes. However, p is only 4 bytes. P is pointing to an 
		adress is either BSS or the data section (depending on which compiler 〞 GNU
		for the former and CC for the latter).

		Answer3
		char a[] = ※string§;
		char *p = ※string§;

		for char a[]＃＃.using the array notation 7 bytes of storage in the static 
		memory block are taken up, one for each character and one for the 
		terminating nul character.
		But, in the pointer notation char *p＃＃＃＃.the same 7 bytes required, plus
		N bytes to store the pointer variable ※p§ (where N depends on the system 
		but is usually a minimum of 2 bytes and can be 4 or more)＃＃

		How do I declare an array of N pointers to functions returning pointers to 
		functions returning pointers to characters?

		Answer1
		If you want the code to be even slightly readable, you will use typedefs.
		typedef char* (*functiontype_one)(void);
		typedef functiontype_one (*functiontype_two)(void);
		functiontype_two myarray[N]; //assuming N is a const integral

		Answer2
		char* (* (*a[N])())()
		Here a is that array. And according to question no function will not take 
		any parameter value.

		What does extern mean in a function declaration?

		It tells the compiler that a variable or a function exists, even if the 
		compiler hasn＊t yet seen it in the file currently being compiled. This 
		variable or function may be defined in another file or further down in the 
		current file.

		How do I initialize a pointer to a function?

		This is the way to initialize a pointer to a function
		void fun(int a)
		{
		}
		void main()
		{
		void (*fp)(int);
		fp=fun;
		fp(1);
		}

		How do you link a C++ program to C functions?

		By using the extern ※C§ linkage specification around the C function 
		declarations.

		Explain the scope resolution operator.

		It permits a program to reference an identifier in the global scope that has
		been hidden by another identifier with the same name in the local scope.

		What are the differences between a C++ struct and C++ class?

		The default member and base-class access specifiers are different.

		How many ways are there to initialize an int with a constant?

		Two.
		There are two formats for initializers in C++ as shown in the example that 
		follows. The first format uses the traditional C notation. The second format
		uses constructor notation.
		int foo = 123;
		int bar (123);

		How does throwing and catching exceptions differ from using setjmp and 
		longjmp?

		The throw operation calls the destructors for automatic objects instantiated
		since entry to the try block.

		What is a default constructor?

		Default constructor WITH arguments class B { public: B (int m = 0) : n (m) {
		} int n; }; int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { B b; return 0; }

		What is a conversion constructor?

		A constructor that accepts one argument of a different type.

		What is the difference between a copy constructor and an overloaded 
		assignment operator?

		A copy constructor constructs a new object by using the content of the 
		argument object. An overloaded assignment operator assigns the contents of 
		an existing object to another existing object of the same class.

		When should you use multiple inheritance?

		There are three acceptable answers: ※Never,§ ※Rarely,§ and ※When the 
		problem domain cannot be accurately modeled any other way.§

		Explain the ISA and HASA class relationships. How would you implement each 
		in a class design?

		A specialized class ※is§ a specialization of another class and, therefore,
		has the ISA relationship with the other class. An Employee ISA Person. This
		relationship is best implemented with inheritance. Employee is derived from
		Person. A class may have an instance of another class. For example, an 
		employee ※has§ a salary, therefore the Employee class has the HASA 
		relationship with the Salary class. This relationship is best implemented by
		embedding an object of the Salary class in the Employee class.

		When is a template a better solution than a base class?

		When you are designing a generic class to contain or otherwise manage 
		objects of other types, when the format and behavior of those other types 
		are unimportant to their containment or management, and particularly when 
		those other types are unknown (thus, the genericity) to the designer of the 
		container or manager class.

		What is a mutable member?

		One that can be modified by the class even when the object of the class or 
		the member function doing the modification is const.

		What is an explicit constructor?

		A conversion constructor declared with the explicit keyword. The compiler 
		does not use an explicit constructor to implement an implied conversion of 
		types. It＊s purpose is reserved explicitly for construction.

		What is the Standard Template Library (STL)?

		A library of container templates approved by the ANSI committee for 
		inclusion in the standard C++ specification.
		A programmer who then launches into a discussion of the generic programming 
		model, iterators, allocators, algorithms, and such, has a higher than 
		average understanding of the new technology that STL brings to C++ 
		programming.

		Describe run-time type identification.

		The ability to determine at run time the type of an object by using the 
		typeid operator or the dynamic_cast operator.

		What problem does the namespace feature solve?

		Multiple providers of libraries might use common global identifiers causing 
		a name collision when an application tries to link with two or more such 
		libraries. The namespace feature surrounds a library＊s external 
		declarations with a unique namespace that eliminates the potential for those
		collisions.
		This solution assumes that two library vendors don＊t use the same namespace
		identifier, of course.

		Are there any new intrinsic (built-in) data types?

		Yes. The ANSI committee added the bool intrinsic type and its true and false
		value keywords.

		Will the following program execute?
		void main()
		{
		void *vptr = (void *) malloc(sizeof(void));
		vptr++;
		}

		Answer1
		It will throw an error, as arithmetic operations cannot be performed on void
		pointers.

		Answer2
		It will not build as sizeof cannot be applied to void* ( error ※Unknown 
		size§ )

		Answer3
		How can it execute if it won＊t even compile? It needs to be int main, not 
		void main. Also, cannot increment a void *.

		Answer4
		According to gcc compiler it won＊t show any error, simply it executes. but 
		in general we can＊t do arthematic operation on void, and gives size of void
		as 1

		Answer5
		The program compiles in GNU C while giving a warning for ※void main§. The 
		program runs without a crash. sizeof(void) is ※1? hence when vptr++, the 
		address is incremented by 1.

		Answer6
		Regarding arguments about GCC, be aware that this is a C++ question, not C. 
		So gcc will compile and execute, g++ cannot. g++ complains that the return 
		type cannot be void and the argument of sizeof() cannot be void. It also 
		reports that ISO C++ forbids incrementing a pointer of type ＆void*＊.

		Answer7
		in C++
		voidp.c: In function `int main()＊:
		voidp.c:4: error: invalid application of `sizeof＊ to a void type
		voidp.c:4: error: `malloc＊ undeclared (first use this function)
		voidp.c:4: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each
		function it appears in.)
		voidp.c:6: error: ISO C++ forbids incrementing a pointer of type `void*＊
		But in c, it work without problems

		void main()
		{
		char *cptr = 0?2000;
		long *lptr = 0?2000;
		cptr++;
		lptr++;
		printf(§ %x %x§, cptr, lptr);
		}Will it execute or not?

		Answer1
		For Q2: As above, won＊t compile because main must return int. Also, 0℅2000
		cannot be implicitly converted to a pointer (I assume you meant 0℅2000 and
		not 0?2000.)

		Answer2
		Not Excute.
		Compile with VC7 results following errors:
		error C2440: ＆initializing＊ : cannot convert from ＆int＊ to ＆char *＊
		error C2440: ＆initializing＊ : cannot convert from ＆int＊ to ＆long *＊
		Not Excute if it is C++, but Excute in C.
		The printout:
		2001 2004

		In C++, what is the difference between method overloading and method 
		overriding?

		Overloading a method (or function) in C++ is the ability for functions of 
		the same name to be defined as long as these methods have different 
		signatures (different set of parameters). Method overriding is the ability 
		of the inherited class rewriting the virtual method of the base class.

		What methods can be overridden in Java?

		In C++ terminology, all public methods in Java are virtual. Therefore, all 
		Java methods can be overwritten in subclasses except those that are declared
		final, static, and private.

		What are the defining traits of an object-oriented language?

		The defining traits of an object-oriented langauge are:
		* encapsulation
		* inheritance
		* polymorphism

		Write a program that ask for user input from 5 to 9 then calculate the 
		average

		int main()
		{
		int MAX=4;
		int total =0;
		int average=0;
		int numb;
		cout<<§Please enter your input from 5 to 9∪;
		cin>>numb;
		if((numb <5)&&(numb>9))
		cout<<§please re type your input§;
		else
		for(i=0;i<=MAX; i++)
		{
		total = total + numb;
		average= total /MAX;
		}
		cout<<§The average number is§<return 0;
		}

		Assignment Operator 每 What is the diffrence between a ※assignment operator
		§ and a ※copy constructor§?

		Answer1.
		In assignment operator, you are assigning a value to an existing object. But
		in copy constructor, you are creating a new object and then assigning a 
		value to that object. For example:
		complex c1,c2;
		c1=c2; //this is assignment
		complex c3=c2; //copy constructor

		Answer2.
		A copy constructor is used to initialize a newly declared variable from an 
		existing variable. This makes a deep copy like assignment, but it is 
		somewhat simpler:
		There is no need to test to see if it is being initialized from itself.
		There is no need to clean up (eg, delete) an existing value (there is none).
		A reference to itself is not returned.

		※mutable§ Keyword 每 What is ※mutable§?

		Answer1.
		※mutable§ is a C++ keyword. When we declare const, none of its data 
		members can change. When we want one of its members to change, we declare it
		as mutable.

		Answer2.
		A ※mutable§ keyword is useful when we want to force a ※logical const§ 
		data member to have its value modified. A logical const can happen when we 
		declare a data member as non-const, but we have a const member function 
		attempting to modify that data member. For example:
		class Dummy {
		public:
		bool isValid() const;
		private:
		mutable int size_ = 0;
		mutable bool validStatus_ = FALSE;
		// logical const issue resolved
		};
		bool Dummy::isValid() const
		// data members become bitwise const
		{
		if (size > 10) {
		validStatus_ = TRUE; // fine to assign
		size = 0; // fine to assign
		}
		}

		Answer2.
		※mutable§ keyword in C++ is used to specify that the member may be updated
		or modified even if it is member of constant object. Example:
		class Animal {
		private:
		string name;
		string food;
		mutable int age;
		public:
		void set_age(int a);
		};
		void main() {
		const Animal Tiger(a?Fulffya?,＊antelope
		a?,1);
		Tiger.set_age(2);
		// the age can be changed since its mutable
		}

		RTTI 每 What is RTTI?

		Answer1.
		RTTI stands for ※Run Time Type Identification§. In an inheritance 
		hierarchy, we can find out the exact type of the objet of which it is member
		. It can be done by using:
		1) dynamic id operator
		2) typecast operator

		Answer2.
		RTTI is defined as follows: Run Time Type Information, a facility that 
		allows an object to be queried at runtime to determine its type. One of the 
		fundamental principles of object technology is polymorphism, which is the 
		ability of an object to dynamically change at runtime.

		STL Containers 每 What are the types of STL containers?

		There are 3 types of STL containers:
		1. Adaptive containers like queue, stack
		2. Associative containers like set, map
		3. Sequence containers like vector, deque

		Virtual Destructor 每 What is the need for a?Virtual 
		Destructor?

		Destructors are declared as virtual because if do not declare it as virtual 
		the base class destructor will be called before the derived class destructor
		and that will lead to memory leak because derived classa?
		s objects will not get freed.Destructors are declared virtual so as to bind 
		objects to the methods at runtime so that appropriate destructor is called.

		Differences of C and C++
		Could you write a small program that will compile in C but not in C++?

		In C, if you can a const variable e.g.
		const int i = 2;
		you can use this variable in other module as follows
		extern const int i;
		C compiler will not complain.

		But for C++ compiler u must write
		extern const int i = 2;
		else error would be generated.

		Bitwise Operations 每 Given inputs X, Y, Z and operations | and & (meaning 
		bitwise OR and AND, respectively), what is output equal to in?
		output = (X & Y) | (X & Z) | (Y & Z);




		============================================================================
		=======================================================

		1.      Will the following program execute?void main()
		{
		void *vptr = (void *) malloc(sizeof(void));
		vptr++;
		}

		Compile error. Cannot convert from int to char*.



		2.      How about this one?
		void main()
		{
		char *cptr = 0X2000;
		long *lptr = 0X2000;
		cptr++;
		lptr++;
		printf(§ %x %x§, cptr, lptr);
		}Will it execute or not?

		Compile error as the sizeof operator cannot be used with void. And we cannot
		get the size of size of void*, so vptr++ also produce compile error.



		3.      When the processor wakes up after power on, it goes to a particular 
		memory location. What is that memory location called?

		Wossit got to do with C++?



		processor goes to MBR (master boot record) then i takes the address of boot 
		loader form thr and execute this boot loader program



		4.      What is the difference between Mutex and Binary semaphore?

		From Multithreaded Applications in Win32, by Jim Beveridge ( page 93 ):
		※＃it turns out that a mutex is a degenerated form of a semaphore. If you 
		create a semaphore and set the maximum count to one, you get mutual 
		exclusion behavior. therefore a mutex is often refered to as a binary 
		semaphore＃In Win32, the ownership semantics of how the two operate are 
		quite different, so they cannot be used interchangeably＃§



		Mutex is efficent than semaphore. Also unlocking of mutex can be done by the
		thread which owns the lock. Not the case with semaphore.



		5.      Write a program to set 2nd bit in a 32 bit register with memory 
		location 0℅2000?

		By ※2nd bit§ are you counting from most significant or least significant 
		bit? Anyway, the answer is platform-dependent and compiler-dependent. 
		Assuming you have a typedef ※uint32∪ that is exactly 32 bits long, then 
		try something like *reinterpret_cast(0℅2000) = 0℅40000000 (for 2nd msb) or
		= 2 (for 2nd lsb)



		6.

		void main()

		{

		printf("%d\n");

		printf("%d %d\n");

		printf("%d %d %d\n");

		}

		Output:

		0

		0 309590428

		0 309590428 2147348480



		Why this?



		7.

		void main()

		{

		int *p = 0;//0 is NULL

		delete p;

		}

		NO error and warning.

		This is just a plug, from me, for you to know about processes, threads and 
		concurrency issues. A lot of interviewers ask about that stuff, and it's 
		pretty fundamental, so you should know it. Know about locks and mutexes and 
		semaphores and monitors and how they work. Know about deadlock and livelock 
		and how to avoid them. Know what resources a processes needs, and a thread 
		needs, and how context switching works, and how it's initiated by the 
		operating system and underlying hardware. Know a little about scheduling. 
		The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core, and you'll be a dinosaur in 
		a real hurry if you don't understand the fundamentals of "modern" (which is 
		to say, "kinda broken") concurrency constructs.

			1. A pointer can be re-assigned any number of times while a reference 
		can not be reassigned after initialization. 
			2. A pointer can point to NULL while reference can never point to NULL
			3. You can't take the address of a reference like you can with pointers
			4. There's no "reference arithmetics" (but you can take the address of 
		an object pointed by a reference and do pointer arithmetics on it as in &obj

		17) deep copy & shallow copy
		18) auto pointer
		19) what's the differenc of new & malloc
			? malloc allocates uninitialized memory. The allocated memory has 
		to be released with free.
			? calloc is like malloc but initializes the allocated memory with 
		a constant (0). It needs to be freed with free.
			? new initializes the allocated memory by calling the constructor 
		(if it's an object). Memory allocated with new should be released with 
		delete (which in turn calls the destructor). It does not need you to 
		manually specify the size you need and cast it to the appropriate type. Thus
		, it's more modern and less prone to errors.

		4.Additive numbers are defined to be a positive integer whose digits form an
		additive sequence. E.g. 11235 (1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5). What makes it 
		difficult is that 12,122,436 is also one (12+12=24, 12+24=36). Given a range
		of integers, find all the additive numbers in that range.
